# AGENTS.md — cross-app coordination playbook

This is the operating contract for **every AI session working on any of the four
apps that share one Supabase database** (PM/PIM `poppim-web`, CRM `popcrm-web`,
DAM `popdam-web`, and the `directus` backend). Read it before touching code or
the database. It exists to stop four apps — often driven by separate AI sessions
— from breaking each other through the one database they all depend on.

## 0. The owner is not a programmer

The repository owner directs the work and judges results, but does **not** review
code, manage branches, or merge pull requests. Therefore:

- **The AI owns all git mechanics.** Branches, commits, pull requests, and merges
  are the AI's job from start to finish. Never leave an open PR for the owner to
  deal with — open it *and* merge it within the same piece of work, once it is
  safe (see §4).
- **The owner reviews behavior, not code.** Their feedback is "the board doesn't
  load," "the dropdown is empty." Translate that into changes yourself.
- **Surface risk in plain English.** Before anything hard to undo (dropping a
  column, applying to production, deleting data), explain the risk in one or two
  plain sentences and ask. Approval for one change does not extend to the next.

## 1. Two workflows — choose by where you are working

| Where | Workflow | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **An app repo** (`poppim-web`, `popcrm-web`, `popdam-web`, `directus`) | Commit straight to **`main`. No branches.** Build must pass, then push; CI deploys. | One app, one owner, a deploy you can watch. Branches add ceremony with no safety gain. Fix-forward or revert on `main`. |
| **This repo** (`shared-db`) | **Branch + PR, and the AI merges it** once the §4 checklist passes. | All four apps read these tables. A bad change breaks everyone at once. The PR is a safety checkpoint and an undo button — not paperwork for the owner. |

## 1.1 Host/server boundary

This repo owns shared database schema, Supabase migrations, PLM import code, and the `systemd/plm-sync.*` templates. Durable host/OS changes on `hetz` are owned by the canonical Ansible repo at `/worksp/ansible` / [`u2giants/ansible`](https://github.com/u2giants/ansible), then applied by GitHub Actions.

Route packages, users, firewall, SSH/sudo, Docker engine or daemon config, systemd units/timers, cron, `/etc`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/local/sbin`, Cloudflare Tunnel 1, Coolify host glue, and backup/DNS watchdogs through an Ansible PR. Do not SSH, sudo, or hand-edit the host directly for durable infrastructure changes. App/database code and templates that belong to `shared-db` still change here; deploying those templates onto the host belongs in Ansible. Break-glass direct host repair must be explicit and followed by an Ansible PR that captures or reconciles the drift.

## 2. Why `shared-db` is the dangerous one

Every app reads and writes the **same tables in the same Supabase project**. A
single schema change here can break an app that a different session built months
ago. The database has no "just this app" — it is always shared. That is why the
four rules below are non-negotiable for any database change.

## 3. The four anti-collision rules (shared database)

1. **One schema change in flight at a time.** Before starting database work,
   check whether another change is already in progress (§5). If so, finish or
   land that one first, or coordinate with the owner. Two simultaneous schema
   edits are the number-one cause of a broken shared database.
2. **Preview database first. Production never receives untested schema.** Apply
   every migration to the preview branch (`xjcyeuvzkhtzsheknaiu`), prove it
   works, *then* promote to production (`qsllyeztdwjgirsysgai`).
3. **Additive by default (expand, then contract).** Adding a column or table
   cannot break another app. **Renaming or dropping** one that another app reads
   *will*. Default to additive changes. Only rename/drop after explicit owner
   sign-off and a checked deprecation across all four apps.
4. **New timestamped migration files only.** Each change is a new
   `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_*.sql` file. Never edit a migration that has already been
   applied anywhere — that is how two sessions silently clobber each other.

## 4. The `shared-db` merge protocol (the checklist the AI runs)

Merge a `shared-db` PR **only when every item is true**:

1. `scripts/check-sql.sh` passes.
2. `supabase db push --dry-run` against the preview branch is clean (only the
   intended changes, no surprise drops/renames).
3. The migration is applied to the **preview** branch and works there.
4. Every app that depends on the change has been tested against preview and the
   owner has confirmed the behavior is correct.
5. The change is additive, or any removal was explicitly approved.

Then: merge to `main` (this auto-syncs the `shared-db/` folder into all apps) and
promote to **production only in an approved window**. Docs-only PRs (no schema
change) need just items 1 and "it reads correctly" — merge them promptly.

## 5. How to tell if a change is already in flight

Before starting database work, run these and read the result:

```bash
gh pr list                      # open shared-db PRs
git branch -a && git ls-remote  # in-progress branches
ls supabase/migrations          # files not yet applied to production
git status --short              # uncommitted migration files in the working tree
```

If anything looks like in-progress database work, **stop and serialize** — land
it (or ask the owner) before adding your own schema change.

## 6. When two apps need conflicting database changes

Serialize, do not parallelize. Land one change, let it sync, test it, then start
the next. Where possible, prefer one **additive** change that satisfies both apps
rather than two competing edits. If they genuinely conflict, explain the trade-off
to the owner in plain English and let them choose order.

## 7. Project references

```text
Preview project ref:  xjcyeuvzkhtzsheknaiu   (Supabase branch "shared-db-schema-rehearsal")
Production project ref: qsllyeztdwjgirsysgai
```

Never commit anon keys, service-role keys, database passwords, or `.env` files.

## 9. Hosted-Supabase gotchas (do not relearn these the hard way)

These bit the CRM production cutover (2026-06-21). PM/PIM will hit the same ones.

- **PostgREST schema exposure is control-plane config, NOT SQL.** The
  `alter role authenticator set pgrst.db_schemas = ...` + `notify pgrst,'reload config'`
  statements in `20260621151419_crm_rls_realtime.sql` do **not** take effect on
  hosted Supabase — the platform overrides them. To expose non-default schemas
  (`api, crm, pim, core`) you must call the Management API:
  `PATCH https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/{ref}/postgrest`
  with `{"db_schema":"public,graphql_public,api,crm,pim,core"}`. It is a per-project
  setting; **re-confirm it after any project restore/clone**, and set it on the
  preview branch too. If supabase-js suddenly 404s on `api.*`/`crm.*`, check this first.
- **`service_role` has no rights on non-`public` schemas by default.** Server-side
  scripts/workers using the service-role key get "permission denied for schema core/crm"
  until granted. The grants live in `20260621164759_service_role_grants.sql`
  (usage + ALL on tables/sequences for `app, core, crm, pim, plm, ingest, api`,
  plus default privileges). Re-run/verify after adding new schemas.
- **Supabase Auth has one `site_url`; every app needs explicit redirect allowlist entries.**
  The production project's Auth `site_url` is `https://crm.designflow.app`, so OAuth
  flows for PM/DAM/SG/master-data apps must pass an explicit app-origin `redirectTo`
  and that origin must be in `uri_allow_list`. Keep bare origin, trailing-slash origin,
  and `/**` wildcard entries for `crm`, `crm-dev`, `pm`, `pm-dev`, `pm-ci`, `dam`,
  `sg`, and `master` designflow hosts. If Microsoft SSO from one app lands on CRM,
  check `GET /v1/projects/qsllyeztdwjgirsysgai/config/auth` before changing frontend
  routing.
- **Ingested domains are never customers.** `crm.ingested_domain` is CRM-private
  email triage data only. It must not FK to, promote into, source-ref, join as,
  feed picker lists for, or otherwise associate with `core.customer`. The
  corrective migration `20260629034500_remove_ingested_domain_customer_association.sql`
  removed `api.customer_list`, `crm.promote_ingested_domain(...)`,
  `crm.ingested_domain.promoted_customer_id`, and all `directus/ingested_domains`
  customer source refs after 3,741 polluted refs were found in production.
- **`unique nulls not distinct (external_source, external_id)`** on `crm.*` and
  `core.*` tables means you cannot bulk-insert many rows with both columns NULL —
  the second NULL/NULL row collides. Importers must set a real
  `external_source` (e.g. `'directus'`) and a unique `external_id` per row.
- **Cross-schema FKs (e.g. `crm.department.company_id → core.company`) are real and
  enforced**, but PostgREST embed syntax (`select=...,company:company_id(...)`)
  may report "no relationship found" because the schema cache does not auto-detect
  cross-schema FKs. The constraint is still there — verify with `pg_constraint`,
  not with a failed embed.
