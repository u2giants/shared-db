# Licensing Master Data Phase 0 reconciliation — 2026-09-04

## Scope and identity

This is read-only evidence for tracker #1090. It authorizes no database or data change. The repository base was `origin/main` at `f462a411801973371a7dff8b21ae9dd326d191e3`. The production query target was proved by the repository's protected configuration as Supabase project `qsllyeztdwjgirsysgai`. No licensed row values were read or recorded.

The live orchestrator marker was re-resolved immediately before routing and was open marker #2330. #1090 itself remains `work_type: documentation`, `route: repo-maintenance`, `status: blocked`; it is not an author assignment.

## Production migration ledger

Command:

`node scripts/check-migration-ledger-drift.mjs --target production --json`

Result: 613 versions on current main, 589 applied in production, 24 merged but not applied, and zero applied-but-not-merged. Nineteen of the 24 are explicitly retired or deliberately held by the production guard. Five are genuinely pending:

- licensing-related: `20260902222649` (Property uniqueness and reviewed promotion), `20260903125728` (Tier-2 Character promotion contract);
- other workstreams: `20260903200951`, `20260904121037`, `20260904143518`.

The two licensing-related pending versions are not counted as delivered. A migration file or merged pull request is not production proof.

## Live catalog findings

Each object was checked with `node scripts/catalog-truth.mjs --target production <typed-object>`. The tool reads the production migration ledger and catalog through the Management API with `read_only: true`.

Present and applied:

- `plm.licensing_write_authorization` — present; guard foundation version `20260817124545` and the FRIENDS/FRIDA bundle are applied;
- `plm.source_resolution` — present; supported replacement `20260902024541` and browser setter `20260902031743` are applied;
- `core.character` — present; separate Character replacement `20260829004145` is applied;
- `core.property_character_associations` — present;
- Warner-specific canonical evidence bridges — production completion #1380, PR #1385, run 32659028280.

Absent from both current migration truth and the production catalog:

- `core.franchise`;
- `core.property_style_guide` and `core.property_franchise`;
- `dam.asset_property`, `dam.asset_style_guide`, and `dam.asset_franchise`;
- `plm.licensing_source_scope`;
- `plm.licensing_relationship_resolution`.

Repository search also found no general `plm.plan_licensing_consolidation`, `plm.apply_licensing_consolidation`, `plm.plan_licensing_canonical_merge`, `plm.apply_licensing_canonical_merge`, or `plm.licensing_canonical_change_history` definition.

## Evidence-backed completed foundations

- #1140 completion record: PR #1256, merge `e66ad50300281a07ef20a4633b4922038af2ee28`, production verification in governed bundle run 32483394133.
- #1339: FRIENDS/FRIDA six-migration bundle applied and live-verified in run 32483394133 from merge `080cf00df958ef47ec93df30160ba0dd9dabf5d1`.
- #1684 completion record: PR #1712, merge `20ec217fa0f4d3777cf245b9fd2414d53bb1a456`, migration `20260829004145`; live catalog confirms separate `core.character`.
- #1380: PR #1385, merge `fccae7ea54284fe74aa7028a6a3e9ca33b6fa1a2`, production run 32659028280.
- Durable resolution: live ledger/catalog confirms `20260902024541` and `20260902031743` applied and `plm.source_resolution` present.

## Bounded successors and routing

- #2333, ready: canonical Franchise, aliases, canonical provenance and Asset freshness. Exact writes are `core.franchise`, `core.franchise_alias`, `core.character_alias`, `core.taxonomy_source_ref`, and `dam.asset`.
- #2334, blocked on #2333: general canonical relationship bridges and their source-support tables. It preserves and audits the live Property/Character association contract.
- #2335, blocked on #2333/#2334: extend the live durable entity-resolution vocabulary and add source scope, relationship decisions, and candidate/review APIs.
- #2336, blocked on #2333/#2334/#2335: hash-pinned consolidation and reversible canonical merge/history contracts.

All four carry the `db-work` label, `work_type: structural`, `route: shared-db-orchestrator`, exact object scopes, and no data-load authority. They were routed to freshly resolved marker #2330. At routing time all eight author lanes were occupied; #2333 was queued behind an overlapping protected claim, while later successors remained dependency-blocked.

## Still unproven and therefore open

- curated Property review #1941;
- one current complete validated source cycle for every source required by this plan;
- two weekly cycles plus one injected failure per source;
- full ColdLion resolution parity in the durable home;
- every consumer deployed on canonical APIs;
- a normal business cycle with zero compatibility readers;
- retirement of compatibility fields/views and sustained production monitoring.

These are not all structural work. Curated data stays under its governed exception; source automation stays with private source sessions; application cutover stays with each application session. None may be marked complete from this tracker without direct end-to-end evidence.
