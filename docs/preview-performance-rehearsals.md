# Preview performance rehearsals

Performance fixtures must run inside one transaction that is always rolled back. This preserves immutable ledgers such as `dflow.sample_movement`, leaves planner statistics and application rows unchanged, and removes the old need to rebuild the shared preview branch merely to clear test data.

Use `scripts/run-preview-rehearsal-transaction.mjs` with a fixture ID shaped like `AI-PERF-YYYYMMDD-name`. Put the seed, `ANALYZE`, benchmark queries, and evidence queries in one SQL file. Refer to the ID inside SQL with `current_setting('app.fixture_id')` so every generated row remains visibly attributable during the run.

Provide the database URL only through `SUPABASE_DB_URL`; never put it in a command or file. The runner requires the URL to prove the requested preview project ref and hard-refuses production `qsllyeztdwjgirsysgai`, printing the safe ref as target proof before executing.

## What the connection check actually checks

libpq reads the whole URI, not only its authority, and `host`, `hostaddr`, `user`, `port`, `dbname`, `service` and `passfile` given as query parameters override the host and user a reader would see. Those parameters are therefore refused outright rather than interpreted, a URL with no host is refused so libpq cannot take one from the environment, a fragment is refused, and the identity the preview ref must appear in is built from the user, host, path and query together and casefolded before comparison.

## What the SQL check actually checks

Transaction control is refused, including PostgreSQL's own synonyms `END` and `ABORT`, which end the rehearsal transaction exactly as `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` do. Statements that cannot be rolled back are refused. Every backslash is refused, because psql honours a meta-command after a semicolon as readily as at the start of a line and `\connect` would open a new autocommit session this guard never inspected; a rehearsal fixture has no legitimate use for one.

Before rolling back, the wrapper reads a transaction-local setting it made after `BEGIN`. If the fixture ended that transaction by any means, the read raises and the run fails, so the success line cannot be printed for a rehearsal that was not still inside its transaction. Any SQL or connection failure closes the session with its transaction uncommitted.

These refusals are a gate only because CI runs them: `scripts/run-preview-rehearsal-transaction.test.mjs` runs in the SQL migration guards workflow.

This is a static check plus a runtime proof, not a sandbox. Every inherited `PG*` variable except the proved `PGDATABASE` is removed from the child environment, so the caller cannot redirect the connection that way either. It does not bound the cost of a fixture beyond the statement and lock timeouts.

Example invocation:

`node scripts/run-preview-rehearsal-transaction.mjs --project-ref <current-preview-ref> --fixture-id AI-PERF-20260830-inventory --sql-file <rehearsal.sql>`

Successful completion ends with `REHEARSAL_ROLLED_BACK`. Confirm representative fixture rows are absent with a separate read-only query before treating cleanup as proven. Never use branch deletion or rebuild as fixture teardown.
