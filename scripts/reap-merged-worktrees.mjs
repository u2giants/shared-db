/**
 * Retire sub-agent worktrees whose work has already merged (issue #658).
 *
 * Worktrees rot for the same reason handoff files did: the session that made one
 * is gone by the time its pull request merges, and every later session is told
 * -- correctly -- not to touch somebody else's. Measured on al8960ofc,
 * 2026-08-13: 29 worktrees, 12 on branches whose work was already merged.
 *
 * THE TRAP THIS REPO KEEPS FALLING INTO. `main` is squash-merged, which rewrites
 * the commit, so `git branch --merged` cannot see a merged feature branch. On
 * 2026-08-13, 74 of 130 branches looked unmerged to git while their pull request
 * was merged. Any reaper keyed on git ancestry therefore reports live work and
 * refuses to clean, which is why every previous attempt did nothing. This one
 * asks GitHub whether the PULL REQUEST merged, and treats git ancestry only as a
 * second, additive signal.
 *
 * SAFETY, from the global rule that every destructive action must be recoverable:
 *   - Dry run by default. `--apply` is required to remove anything.
 *   - A worktree that is DIRTY, LOCKED, detached, or has unpushed commits is
 *     never removed, printed instead. Uncommitted work is unrecoverable and no
 *     amount of "its PR merged" makes that safe.
 *   - The main checkout is never a candidate.
 *   - `git worktree remove` is used, never `rm -rf`, so git's own refusals apply.

// Issue #1868. The reaper refused to run AT ALL while any orchestrator marker was
// open, and a marker is open nearly all the time, so the reap never happened: the
// worktree count went 31 -> 47 -> 75 -> 81 on this machine while the issue sat
// open. The refusal was right about the hazard and wrong about the remedy. Its
// reasoning was "a clean worktree on a merged branch is indistinguishable from
// one a live agent just pushed from" -- but that is only true if you look at git
// alone. The repo already publishes a POSITIVE liveness signal: every dispatched
// agent holds an open `db-claim` issue naming its exact `worktree:` path and
// branch, and a worktree a process is actually working in has recent filesystem
// activity in its own git administrative directory.
//
// So the guard is now three positive signals instead of one blanket guess, and
// every one of them says KEEP rather than "remove":
//   1. a worktree named by an open database claim is held, marker or no marker;
//   2. the worktree this reap is itself running inside is never a candidate;
//   3. while a marker IS open, a worktree touched within the idle window is
//      treated as live even if nothing claims it, because dispatch and claim
//      creation are not atomic and a just-started agent may not have claimed yet.
// `--force` still exists and still skips the idle window. It is not the way to
// run a routine reap.

 * guess the old blanket refusal was protecting against -- so refuse.
 *
 * A live marker with readable claims is NOT a block any more. That is the whole
 * repair: the reap must be able to run alongside an orchestrator, or it never
 * runs, which is exactly what happened between #1868 being filed and the worktree
 * count reaching 81.
 *
 * THE FIRST ARGUMENT IS THE LIVENESS BIT, NOT THE MARKER LIST. An earlier draft
 * took the marker array and asked `markers.length > 0`. `main` sets that array to
 * `[]` when the marker read FAILS, and separately decides liveness as
 * `!markersReadable || markers.length > 0`. So a run in which BOTH the marker read
 * and the claim read failed -- no idea whether an orchestrator is up, and no idea
 * which worktrees are held -- computed `[].length > 0` and did not refuse.
 * The old code threw on that path and deleted nothing; the draft would have
 * deleted. Found by the governed review of PR #2606. A boolean is demanded here so
 * that passing the array again is an immediate, loud failure rather than a silent
 * false.
