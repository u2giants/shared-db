// One shared GitHub transport for every governed gate (issue #2342).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// Three consecutive production-apply runs (33920952504, 33921168245,
// 33921406952) each refused promotion while naming a DIFFERENT file that
// demonstrably existed. Three different names for the same corrupt state is not
// what a real fault looks like; it is what a spurious per-file read looks like.
// The gate was making up to 112 sequential Contents calls per run and any single
// one of them could stop production.
//
// At that point EIGHT hand-rolled `gh` wrappers existed across scripts/, and
// exactly two of them retried anything. This module is the one wrapper. The
// conformance test (scripts/check-github-transport-conformance.mjs) fails the
// build if a ninth appears.
//
// WHY BATCHING IS THE PRIMARY FIX AND RETRY IS ONLY THE BACKSTOP
// --------------------------------------------------------------
// AGENTS.md records a prior lesson pointing the other way: a retry wrapper that
// turned a fast failure into a slower, identically-named failure. Retrying a
// read you should not have been making 112 times is exactly that mistake with a
// longer wall clock. The exposure is removed by asking GitHub ONCE per ref (a
// recursive tree read) instead of once per file; the retry here only covers the
// genuinely irreducible single call.
//
// WHY 404 IS NOT A TRANSIENT MARKER, EVEN THOUGH THE OBSERVED FAILURES WERE 404s
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is the one place it is tempting to widen the classifier, and it must not
// be widened. Across this repository 404 is an ANSWER, not a fault: "does this
// ref exist yet?" is asked with a read whose negative reply is HTTP 404, and
// several gates depend on believing that reply. A classifier that retries 404
// would make every one of those reads spend its full attempt budget on a
// correct answer, and -- far worse -- a gate that concludes "absent" only after
// retrying is a gate whose absence proof now depends on a timeout. That is a
// fail-open shape, and a gate that fails open is worse than one that fails
// closed.
//
// The observed spurious 404s were removed at the source instead: the promotion
// gate no longer makes per-file Contents calls at all, so the read that was
// lying is no longer made. Fixing the caller beats teaching the classifier to
// distrust a true answer.
//
// WHY MUTATIONS ARE NEVER RETRIED
// -------------------------------
// A retried read costs a duplicate read. A retried POST can create a ref twice,
// post a second comment, or double-advance a lease. `gh` reports a transport
// failure identically whether the request never landed or landed and the
// RESPONSE was lost, so a retry here cannot tell "did nothing" from "already
// did it". Mutating calls therefore get exactly one attempt unless a caller
// proves idempotency by passing `idempotentWrite: true`.
