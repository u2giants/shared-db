// refused with the same "base branch policy prohibits the merge" message that the
// eventual-consistency retry exists for, so the workflow retried a condition no
// retry can resolve, held the lock for minutes, and reported nothing useful. This
// check runs BEFORE the lock is taken and names the exact contexts that are not
// satisfied on the reviewed head.

// WHEN THE REQUIRED LIST CANNOT BE READ FROM THE API.
//
// That read needs administration access, and GitHub Actions HAS NO `administration`
// permission scope -- declaring one makes the workflow file unparseable, which took
// the only merge path in this repository down entirely. So `github.token` cannot read
// it, ever.
//
// The first attempt at this fallback checked only that every check REPORTED on the
// head was green, and claimed that was strictly stronger. It is not, and a governed
// review produced the counterexample: a head with one green non-required check and a
// required context that never reported at all passes the reported-checks test and
// fails the required-list test. Not knowing the required list means not being able to
// notice one is missing.
//
// So the fallback does not guess. It reads a COMMITTED MIRROR of the required list
// (`docs/verification/main-required-status-checks.json`, rewritten by
// `scripts/update-required-checks.mjs` whenever it changes the live list) and applies
// BOTH tests: every mirrored context must be green, AND every check reported on the
// head must be green. The second half is what covers mirror rot -- a context added
// live but not yet mirrored is still caught the moment it reports. A missing or empty
// mirror is a refusal, never an empty required list.
