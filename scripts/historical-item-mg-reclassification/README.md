# Historical item merch-group reclassification tooling

Implements steps 1 and 2 of section 9 of `plan_historical_mg_reclassification_apply.md`:
a private manifest builder, and a guarded executor with its tests, verifier and
rollback. Tracking issue: #1984.

**Nothing here has been run against preview or production.** Building and testing
this tooling is authorized; *running* `apply.mjs --apply` against any live
database is a separate, explicit owner authorization that has not been given.

## What is and is not in this repository

This repository is public. The candidate manifest and the abstention ledger both
carry licensed item identities, so they are written to the **private**
`u2giants/licensor-source-data` repository. Only counts and SHA-256 digests may
be quoted here or in an issue. Item descriptions are never read into a manifest
at all.

The tooling contains no database migration and touches no schema object. It
rewrites six existing columns on existing `dflow."itemHeader"` rows, which is
data-only work under `AGENTS.md` section 0.0-B.

## Locked rules the code enforces

- The May 14, 2025 historical cutoff is a constant, and `assertCutoff` throws on
  any other value. It cannot be passed in, configured, or relaxed.
- The first write batch contains **complete level-3 assignments only**. Every
  candidate needs an exact live, division-qualified, active MG01 to MG02 to MG03
  parent chain. Level-2, level-1 and partial rows abstain.
- Every write targets `item_id_pk` and carries all six before-values in the
  `WHERE` predicate. There is no partial apply: any drift, or any affected-row
  count other than the planned one, rolls back the whole transaction.
- The target is proved from the connection string that is about to be used,
  against an `--expect-project-ref` the operator states explicitly. There is
  deliberately no target-name-to-project-ref lookup table in this code.
- A production apply additionally requires an authorization artifact naming the
  exact manifest digest. Preview authorization can never satisfy production.

The three open section 8 decisions (partial level-2/level-1 application, EP001
treatment, and null-or-conflicting creation dates) are **unanswered owner
decisions**. Nothing here infers them; each simply abstains with its own reason.

## Commands

Dependencies: Node 20+. The repository has no `package.json`, so `pg` is resolved
at run time from an operator-supplied path.

```
MGRC_PG_MODULE=/path/to/node_modules/pg/lib/index.js
MGRC_DATABASE_URL=<connection string, never logged>
```

Build the manifest (read-only):

```
node build-manifest.mjs --source <private level-3 CSV> --target production \
  --expect-project-ref <ref> --out <private output dir>
```

Dry-run the executor (locks, revalidates, rolls back):

```
node apply.mjs --manifest <private manifest.json> --target preview \
  --expect-project-ref <ref> --expect-manifest-sha256 <digest> \
  --backup-out <private dir>
```

Record the untouched-rows baseline, then verify after an apply:

```
node verify.mjs --manifest <file> --target preview --expect-project-ref <ref> --baseline-only
node verify.mjs --manifest <file> --target preview --expect-project-ref <ref> \
  --expect-non-candidate <digest> --expect-non-candidate-rows <n>
```

Roll back (restores only rows still carrying exactly what this batch wrote):

```
node rollback.mjs --backup <file> --target preview --expect-project-ref <ref> \
  --expect-manifest-sha256 <digest>
```

Adding `--apply` to `apply.mjs` or `rollback.mjs` writes rows. Do not.

## Tests

```
node --test scripts/historical-item-mg-reclassification/*.test.mjs
```

38 tests, all offline, all synthetic, no secrets and no database. They cover the
19 cases required by section 10 of the plan. Each one feeds a guard a known-bad
input and asserts the specific refusal, so every guard in this directory has been
observed going red for the right reason rather than merely passing.

## The cutoff-retirement gate

`lib/retirement-gate.mjs` evaluates the seven conditions in section 13 of the
plan. It is expected to FAIL today: 127 live rows have a null creation date, and
condition 1 alone holds it closed. Removing the cutoff from
`api.resolve_item_mg_category(integer)` is a structural change and must be routed
fresh through the shared-db orchestrator after this gate passes.

## Review status

Both independent review slots for this pull request are re-drawn fresh at each
head; this line exists only to produce a clean head with zero recorded verdicts
after a reviewer-lease repair proved structurally blocked at a prior head.
