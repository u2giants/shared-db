// It re-fetches the most recent N CLOSED grid windows every run, because a window that is
// already loaded is skipped and a window that is not is completed.
//
// THE CURRENT WEEK IS NEVER LOADED. Loading a window seals it: the ledger declines it
// afterwards and the database forbids adding page evidence to a loaded window. So a
// window fetched on the first of its seven days would be a permanently incomplete week
// that the ledger reports as complete, and every order written over the remaining six
// days would be lost with no trace. The newest window this ever touches is the one that
// has finished, which means the feed trails real time by up to a week by design.
//
// Trailing more than one closed window is still deliberate: a run that failed, a window
// the vendor refused, and an outage all leave older windows unloaded, and this is what
// completes them without anybody having to notice.
//
// It never marks a loaded window dirty and it never rewrites page evidence. Picking up a
// row that CHANGED after its window closed is the change-log unit's job, not this one's.
