-- Issue #2213 (parent #2209): stop the measured no-op write amplification in the
-- effective-tag projection.
--
-- EVIDENCE THIS IMPLEMENTS (issue #2213, the #2209 Steps 1 & 3 read-only
-- production comment). Over a 7.556-day window ending 2026-09-05:
--
--   * public.asset_effective_tags took 6,762,623 deletes and 6,762,623 inserts
--     after its one-off backfill, and n_live_tup never moved off the backfill's
--     own 2,045,705 rows. Net change from 13,525,246 row versions: ZERO.
--   * All of it came from one PostgREST statement shape,
--     UPDATE "public"."assets" SET "style_group_id" = ..., 710,514 calls, which
--     is the only observed shape naming a column the assets trigger watches.
--     9.52 projection rows were rewritten per firing.
--   * The churn is provably 100% no-op: the assets branch re-derives the set
--     from public.asset_tags (ZERO writes in the window) and
--     public.style_group_tags (EMPTY), so the re-derived set is identical to
--     the set it had just deleted, whether or not style_group_id changed value.
--   * Consequence in the catalogue: 261,433 dead tuples, 11.33% of the table,
--     16 autovacuum cycles, on a projection whose content has not changed since
--     the backfill.
--   * The reported 181-second population is the one-off migration backfill
--     (pg_stat_statements calls = 1), NOT a recurring job.
--
-- WHAT WAS RULED OUT ON THE SAME MEASUREMENT, and is deliberately NOT done here:
--   * A supporting index. The delete already runs as an index scan on the
--     asset_id-leading unique index: idx_tup_fetch 6,762,627 vs n_tup_del
--     6,762,623. The delete path is not scan-bound and no index is missing.
--   * Statement-level transition handling, a durable changed-ID path, and
--     staging/swap. None is needed once the rewrite itself is conditional, and
--     each is a larger change than the evidence supports.
--
-- THE CHANGE. Exactly one thing moves: the assets branch stops being an
-- unconditional delete-all-then-reinsert of the asset's whole tag set and
-- becomes an unchanged-set comparison -- delete only the rows that are no
-- longer derived, insert only the rows that are newly derived. An unchanged
-- input set therefore writes nothing at all.
--
-- The asset_tags and style_group_tags branches are transcribed BYTE FOR BYTE
-- from the live baseline (supabase/migrations/20260830110517_popdam_effective_
-- asset_filters.sql, confirmed identical to pg_get_functiondef in production).
-- They were already single-row targeted and contribute none of the measured
-- churn, so touching them would be a speculative rewrite.
--
-- Signature, return type, volatility, SECURITY DEFINER, search_path, the
-- advisory-lock protocol (F2 of the #1664 review) and every grant are preserved
-- exactly. The three triggers are NOT redefined: they keep pointing at this
-- function by name and are outside this change's claimed objects.
--
-- ROLLBACK is a new forward migration restoring the function body from
-- 20260830110517_popdam_effective_asset_filters.sql verbatim. No index, trigger,
-- table, policy or grant is added, altered or removed here, so nothing else has
-- to be restored.
