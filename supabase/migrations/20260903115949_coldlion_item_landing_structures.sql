-- Issue #2172 — ColdLion landing unit 2: correct the item header/detail/merch-group
-- structures. Plan: plan_coldlion_landing_schema_completion.md §9 Step 3.
-- derived-from: 20260825023430
-- 20260825023430_coldlion_raw_landing_phases_2_6.sql is NOT edited; this is a
-- forward migration, per §11 "never edit applied migrations".
--
-- OBJECT CLAIM. This file writes exactly three objects and nothing else:
--   coldlion.item_header, coldlion.item_detail, coldlion.item_merch_group.
--
-- =====================================================================================
-- LIVE EVIDENCE THIS FILE WAS AUTHORED AGAINST (re-sampled 2026-09-03, read-only)
-- =====================================================================================
-- Issue #2172 requires the shape to come from a LIVE SAMPLE, not from /api-docs,
-- because the spec is proven stale for the history feeds. Both were checked:
--
--   * GET /EhpApi/items?companyCode=<co>&size=3&page=0 -> Spring Page envelope
--     (first,last,number,numberOfElements,size,sort,totalElements,totalPages).
--     The live record carries 146 field names; /api-docs ItemHeader declares 146.
--     The two sets are IDENTICAL. For this feed the spec is currently accurate.
--
--   * GET /EhpApi/itemDetails?companyCode=<co>&size=3&page=0 -> BARE JSON ARRAY.
--     There is NO page envelope and the `size` parameter is IGNORED: that request
--     returned the complete 26,747-record set. The live record carries 133 field
--     names; /api-docs ItemDetail declares 133; the sets are IDENTICAL. A loader
--     must not assume `/itemDetails` pages, and must not read `last`/`totalPages`
--     from it — there is no envelope to read them from.
--
-- itemPkey STABILITY, measured rather than assumed (plan §9 Step 3 makes the
-- one-row-per-itemPkey rule conditional on live evidence):
--   26,747 live itemDetails records -> 26,747 distinct `itemPkey`, maximum
--   multiplicity 1, zero null or empty values, and still 26,747 distinct when
--   scoped to (companyCode, divisionCode, itemNo, itemPkey). itemPkey is therefore
--   retained as the SKU key under its parent item, and the parent FK is retained.
--
-- CROSS-DIVISION ITEM NUMBERS ARE REAL, not hypothetical: in the live sample 20
-- item numbers occur under more than one divisionCode within a single companyCode
-- (divisions present: CW001, EH001, EP001, SP001). The three-part item identity
-- (company_code, division_code, item_no) is load-bearing and is preserved
-- unchanged; a two-part key would silently merge those 20 items.
--
-- No source rows, customer identifiers or licensed values are recorded here — only
-- field NAMES and aggregate counts, per §11 (this repository is public).
--
-- =====================================================================================
-- WHAT IS ACTUALLY WRONG WITH THE 20260825023430 SHAPE, AND WHAT THIS FILE CHANGES
-- =====================================================================================
-- 1. coldlion.item_detail stored merchandise groups as FOURTEEN INLINE COLUMNS
--    (merch_group01..merch_group14). The item header already stored its slots as
--    rows in coldlion.item_merch_group, so the same fact was modelled two different
--    ways in the same migration. Inline slot columns cannot satisfy the standing
--    rule that a CLEARED SLOT DISAPPEARS: an upsert writing NULL leaves a row that
--    still claims fourteen slots, and downstream `merch_group05 is null` cannot be
--    told apart from "never loaded". This file MOVES the detail slots into rows.
--
-- 2. coldlion.item_merch_group could only describe HEADER-level slots. ItemDetail
--    carries its own merchGroup01..14 (confirmed live above) and, under owner
--    ruling D16, licensor (slot 05) and property (slot 06) are attributes of the
--    COMPONENT STYLE and are never inherited from the parent assortment. With no
--    detail-level row destination, a loader had only two options, both wrong:
--    drop the component taxonomy, or fall back to the parent's value — which D16
--    forbids outright. item_pkey now scopes the row: NULL = the item-header slot,
--    non-NULL = that specific SKU's slot. Nothing reads one from the other.
--
-- 3. The merchGroupNNDesc family (14 fields on BOTH feeds) and itemDetails.labelDesc
--    are live but carry no row in docs/coldlion-field-decisions-20260819.csv, whose
--    silence is absence and not a decision. The OWNER RULING of 2026-09-03
--    (https://github.com/u2giants/shared-db/issues/2081#issuecomment-5526450180)
--    marks the merchGroupNNDesc family and labelDesc `ingest` on /items and
--    /itemDetails, satisfying D4 for these two feeds IN THEIR OWN RIGHT. It is
--    NOT an extension of D15, whose text answers the history-feed gap list; per
--    the D17 precedent a ruling naming one feed does not travel to another, so
--    this ruling authorises no other field and no other feed.
--    They are DESCRIPTIONS: evidence, never keys. The slot
--    description is therefore stored ON THE SLOT ROW (mg_desc) beside the code it
--    describes, and label_desc inline beside label_code. No key, constraint or
--    index anywhere in this file uses a description.
--
-- 4. Every other approved (`ingest`) field of both feeds was checked column by
--    column against the live field list: items has 78 ingest fields, 14 of which
--    are the merchGroup slots, and all 64 remaining are already columns of
--    coldlion.item_header; itemDetails has 59, 14 slots, and all 45 remaining are
--    already columns of coldlion.item_detail. So NO scalar column is added to
--    either table beyond label_desc, and none is renamed. The declined fields
--    (54 on items, 59 on itemDetails) map nowhere and are still absent.
--
-- NOT DONE HERE, DELIBERATELY: no loader (plan Step 7 owns loaders), no promotion
-- view or grant (Step 8), no row load of any kind, and no taxonomy interpretation.
-- Unknown-field refusal is a loader contract; this file records the sampled shape
-- the refusal must be keyed to, and the tests prove the structure that supports it.

comment on table coldlion.item_merch_group is
  'ColdLion merchandise-group slots as ROWS, for both grains. item_pkey IS NULL is the '
  'item-header slot; item_pkey NOT NULL is that SKU''s own slot. All fourteen slots are '
  'representable at each grain. A CLEARED SLOT IS DELETED by the current-state loader in '
  'the same transaction as its parent upsert - upsert-only would preserve stale taxonomy, '
  'and mg_code may not be blank, so a cleared slot cannot be faked as an empty string. '
  'Owner ruling D16: licensor (slot 05) and property (slot 06) describe the COMPONENT '
  'style, never the Master assortment. A detail slot is NEVER defaulted, copied or fallen '
  'back from the item-header slot, in either direction. THIS IS A LOADER RULE, NOT A '
  'SCHEMA GUARANTEE: this table only makes a compliant loader possible by giving each '
  'grain its own row. No constraint here can detect a loader that copies the parent '
  'value onto a SKU, because a SKU may legitimately share its parent licensor (D14 '
  'measured that in a substantial minority of prepack groups), so value-equality '
  'enforcement would reject real data. D16 is enforced by the Step 7 loader and the '
  'Step 8 promotion contract.';

comment on column coldlion.item_merch_group.item_pkey is
  'NULL = item-header grain. NOT NULL = the itemDetails SKU this slot belongs to. The '
  'uniqueness constraint uses NULLS NOT DISTINCT so replaying a header-scoped slot cannot '
  'duplicate it.';

comment on column coldlion.item_merch_group.mg_desc is
  'merchGroupNNDesc for this slot (owner ruling 2026-09-03, issue #2081 comment '
  '5526450180: ingest on /items and /itemDetails). Evidence, never a key: no '
  'constraint or index in this schema uses a description.';

comment on table coldlion.item_detail is
  'One ColdLion SKU keyed by itemPkey under its parent item. itemPkey stability was '
  'MEASURED live on 2026-09-03, not assumed: 26,747 records, 26,747 distinct itemPkey, '
  'no nulls or blanks, maximum multiplicity 1. Merchandise groups are NOT stored here - '
  'they are rows in coldlion.item_merch_group scoped by item_pkey, so a cleared slot can '

-- 3. item_header: identity restated, no scalar column added.
-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
comment on table coldlion.item_header is
  'One ColdLion item per company + division + item number. The division is part of the '
  'identity because the SAME item number genuinely occurs in different divisions - 20 such '
  'item numbers were counted in the live sample of 2026-09-03 - and a two-part key would '
  'silently merge them. All 64 non-slot approved (ingest) ItemHeader fields are already '
  'columns here; the 14 merchGroup slots are rows in coldlion.item_merch_group with '
  'item_pkey IS NULL. The 54 declined ItemHeader fields map nowhere and stay absent.';
