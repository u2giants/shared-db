-- Issue #2175 - ColdLion landing UNIT 5a: the two remainder feeds whose grain is proven.
--
-- Tracker: #2081. Plan: plan_coldlion_landing_schema_completion.md section 9 Step 6.
-- Author lane claim: #2184. Structure only; this migration loads no rows and creates
-- no loader.
--
-- WHAT THIS ADDS
-- --------------
--   coldlion.inventory      /inventory     - warehouse stock position, paged envelope
--   coldlion.prod_tracking  /prodtracking  - open production orders, BARE ARRAY
--
-- Both hang off the phase-1 spine (20260818232639) and follow the phases 2-6 landing
-- conventions (20260825023430): ColdLion field names transliterated to snake_case, no
-- per-row raw archive (D5), no foreign keys into core.*, no application grants, a
-- current-state source_hash over the complete fetched record before projection, and
-- first_seen_at / last_seen_at bookkeeping.
--
-- EVIDENCE. THE SPEC IS NOT THE CONTRACT.
-- ---------------------------------------
-- GET /EhpApi/v2/api-docs types BOTH of these feeds as a bare {"type":"object"}: 14 of
-- its 16 GET feeds are untyped, and where it DOES type a feed it is wrong (both history
-- feeds are declared as raw arrays but live-return a Spring Page envelope). Every column
-- and every constraint below comes from live sampling on 2026-09-02, recorded in
-- docs/coldlion-unit-5a-grain-proof-20260902.md. A loader built on this schema must key
-- its unknown-field refusal to that SAMPLED SHAPE and never to /api-docs.
--
-- GRAIN PROOF 1 - /inventory. Whole population, not a sample: five pages, 8,754 of 8,754
-- rows for companyCode=EDGEHOME, 12 fields in the union, zero nulls in any field.
--   * (item_pkey, warehouse_code) is unique across all 8,754 rows.
--   * item_pkey ALONE is NOT unique (7,412 / 8,754) - one item sits in many warehouses.
--   * The descriptive tuple (division, itemNo, color, size, dim, label, prepack,
--     warehouse) is ALSO NOT unique (8,499 / 8,754). Those columns describe the row;
--     they do not identify it. itemPkey does.
-- The payload carries NO companyCode, so company_code is stamped from the request and
-- leads the primary key - two companies could otherwise collide on one itemPkey.
--
-- GRAIN PROOF 2 - /prodtracking. Also whole population, for a reason that matters:
--   ** THE FILTER PARAMETERS ARE INERT. ** Three probes - companyCode=EDGEHOME with a
--   June-2026 window, companyCode=SPRUCE with a January-2019 window, and no parameters
--   at all - returned three byte-identical 4,885,440-byte bodies (equal SHA-256). The
--   feed is a full snapshot of 3,922 rows spanning prodOrderDate 2019-05-03 to
--   2026-09-02 across all three company codes, every time. There is no incremental
--   window here and no page envelope, so window_ledger has nothing to record for it. A
--   loader must treat every pull as a complete replacement snapshot.
--   * 51 fields in the union across all 3,922 rows. The 2026-09-02 census on #2081 said
--     52; re-derived at authoring time it is 51. Neither number is a contract - re-derive
--     again before the loader lands.
--   * companyCode IS present in this payload (unlike /inventory).
--   * (company_code, prod_order_no) identifies a row: 3,917 distinct over 3,922 rows.
--     The 5 collisions are five pairs of rows with ZERO differing fields - byte-identical
--     duplicate emissions, not two versions of one order. That is the only duplicate
--     collapse this table performs and it is measured, not assumed, so the primary key is
--     natural and is not a guess. If a future pull ever produces two rows sharing that key
--     with DIFFERENT payloads the upsert is no longer safe and this grain must be
--     re-proven before loading.
--
-- SOURCE RULES CARRIED FORWARD FROM THE SPINE
-- -------------------------------------------
--   * 1900-01-01 is ColdLion's empty-date marker. Typed date columns store NULL for it.
--     Live proof in this feed: cancel_date, start_date and order_date carry the marker on
--     3,911 of 3,922 rows and ship_date on 790. A loader that stores 1900-01-01 as a real
--     date turns "no date" into "shipped in 1900" on 99.7% of the table.
--   * ColdLion sends '' where other systems send null. All 12 /inventory fields and all
--     51 /prodtracking fields were non-null in the full population, but blanks are common
--     (dim_code 1,891, prepack_code 1,593 and label_code 732 of 8,754 on /inventory;
--     lc_no, freight_forwarder_code and season_code blank on ALL 3,922 prod_tracking
--     rows). Text columns are therefore nullable and are NOT check-constrained non-blank:
--     the landing layer records what arrived.
--
-- TWO THINGS DELIBERATELY NOT DONE
-- --------------------------------
--   * NO EP001 EXCLUSION CHECK. The phases 2-6 tables carry check (division_code <> 'EP001')
--     because those feeds are curated-master shaped. Both of these feeds actually CONTAIN
--     EP001 rows today, so the same check would make faithful landing impossible and would
--     fail the load rather than filter it. EP001 handling stays a loader contract.
--     Related trap for whoever writes that loader: division_code arrives in both casings -
--     'CW001' and 'cw001' are both live in both feeds. Nothing here normalises it.
--   * NO IMAGE-CONTENT TABLE, here or ever (owner decision). PopDAM is the image source.

comment on table coldlion.inventory is
  'ColdLion GET /inventory landing table (issue #2175, unit 5a). One row per company + itemPkey + warehouseCode; proven unique over the whole 8,754-row EDGEHOME population on 2026-09-02, while itemPkey alone (7,412 distinct) and the full descriptive tuple (8,499) are both NOT unique. Twelve source fields, paged Spring envelope. company_code is stamped from the request because the payload omits it. Contains EP001 rows; no exclusion is enforced here. Grain proof: docs/coldlion-unit-5a-grain-proof-20260902.md.';

comment on column coldlion.inventory.company_code is

comment on column coldlion.inventory.warehouse_code is

comment on column coldlion.inventory.warehouse_sku is
  'ColdLion warehouseSku. Frequently equal to itemNo but not proven to be, and not unique per warehouse (division + sku + warehouse gave 1,905 distinct over a 2,000-row page). Descriptive only - never join on it.';

comment on table coldlion.prod_tracking is
  'ColdLion GET /prodtracking landing table (issue #2175, unit 5a). Open-production-order grain, one row per company + prodOrderNo, proven over the entire 3,922-row feed on 2026-09-02. THE FILTER PARAMETERS ARE INERT: companyCode and fromDate/toDate are ignored and every request returns the identical full snapshot (three probes, byte-identical bodies), so every pull is a complete replacement and window_ledger has nothing to record. Bare JSON array - NO page envelope. 51 source fields as sampled; the #2081 census said 52, so re-derive before the loader lands. Grain proof: docs/coldlion-unit-5a-grain-proof-20260902.md.';

comment on column coldlion.prod_tracking.prod_order_no is
