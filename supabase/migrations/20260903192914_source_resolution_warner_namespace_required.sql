-- Require a non-blank namespace after the `warner:` prefix in the plm.source_resolution
-- source vocabulary.
--
-- Migration: 20260903192914_source_resolution_warner_namespace_required.sql
-- Issue:     u2giants/shared-db #2159
-- Claim:     u2giants/shared-db #2226 -- table plm.source_resolution. Nothing else.
-- derived-from: none
--
-- Depends on (exact 14-digit versions):
--   20260902024541  source_resolution_supported_home -- creates plm.source_resolution and the
--                   constraint this file narrows.
--   20260903015023  source_resolution_wildbrain_vocabulary -- the immediately preceding state
--                   of that same constraint. Every value IT accepted, except the empty-namespace
--                   Warner form this issue is about, is re-asserted below by real inserts.
--   20260813230000  wb_normalized_source_schema -- creates plm.wb_property, whose
--                   source_namespace is the namespace that goes after the colon. READ ONLY as
--                   evidence for the shape; this file neither reads nor writes it.
--
-- LOADS NO DATA. No row is inserted into plm.source_resolution by this file. u2giants/shared-db
-- is a PUBLIC repository: SCHEMA IN GIT, DATA OUT OF GIT.
--
-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE DEFECT
--
-- The deployed expression admits Warner values through `source_system like 'warner:%'`.
-- In SQL, `%` matches ZERO characters, so the bare string `'warner:'` -- a Warner row whose
-- namespace is empty -- is accepted. `source_resolution_source_system_nonblank_chk` does not
-- catch it either: `btrim('warner:')` is `'warner:'`, which is not blank.
--
-- That matters because the namespace is not decoration. plm.wb_property keys identity on
-- (source_namespace, source_id), so a Warner source ID is unique only WITHIN its namespace,
-- and 20260814233423 writes `'warner:' || p.source_namespace` into source_system precisely to
-- carry that dimension. A row spelled `warner:` therefore records a durable resolution
-- decision that names no source namespace at all: it is unresolvable back to a capture, and
-- it sorts and groups alongside genuine Warner values.
--
-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHY THIS SHAPE, DERIVED AND NOT ASSUMED
--
-- The issue offers `warner:_%` as the obvious form. `_` requires exactly one character, so
-- `warner:_%` refuses `'warner:'` -- but it ACCEPTS `'warner: '` and `'warner:   '`, which are
-- namespaces made only of whitespace and are exactly as unresolvable as the empty one.
--
-- The family the namespace comes from says non-blank, not merely non-empty:
--
--   * plm.wb_property pins source_namespace by CHECK to
--     ('warner_product_catalogue','warner_art_assets') -- 20260813230000 line 22.
--   * Its four sibling landing tables (wb_franchise, wb_character_normalized,
--     wb_style_guide_normalized, and the asset table) each require
--     `btrim(source_namespace) <> ''`.
--
-- So the invariant the source side actually enforces is a NON-BLANK namespace, and that is
-- what is required here:
--
--     source_system like 'warner:%' and btrim(substring(source_system from length('warner:')+1)) <> ''
--
-- This is deliberately NOT a pin to the two literal namespaces plm.wb_property currently
-- allows. The vocabulary comment has always described this side as `warner:<source_namespace>`
-- for an OPEN set of namespaces, and pinning two literals here would silently couple this
-- constraint to a CHECK on another table that is not in this claim. Requiring a non-blank
-- namespace closes the hole the issue names and nothing else. `warner:x` is still accepted,
-- and it is proved accepted below.
--
-- NO OTHER VALUE HAS THE SAME HOLE. Every other member of the vocabulary is an exact literal
-- in an `IN` list -- `paramount`, `nbcu`, `disney_opa`, `disney_dcpvault`,
-- `lucasfilm_dcpvault`, `marvel_dcpvault`, `twentieth_century_dcpvault`, `wildbrain`. There is
-- exactly one LIKE pattern in the expression, and it is the Warner one. A zero-length-wildcard
-- hole needs a wildcard, so no other value can carry one.
--
-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- NO EXISTING ROW IS INVALIDATED
--
-- Checked read-only against production (project qsllyeztdwjgirsysgai, proved with
-- get_project_url immediately before the read) while authoring this file:
-- plm.source_resolution holds 0 rows and 0 distinct source_system values, so 0 rows carry the
-- empty-namespace form. That is a point-in-time read and is NOT what this migration relies on.
-- The ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT below is a VALIDATING add: PostgreSQL scans every existing
-- row as part of it, and the apply fails loudly with SQLSTATE 23514 naming
-- `source_resolution_source_system_supported_chk` if even one row would be invalidated. There
-- is no NOT VALID and no exclusion clause, so a row that appears between now and the apply
-- cannot be silently stranded -- it stops the migration, which is the data finding the issue
-- asks for.
--
-- NARROWED ON PURPOSE, AND ONLY HERE. This is a deliberate narrowing of exactly one form. Every
-- other value the previous expression accepted is re-asserted below by real inserts, so an
-- accidental wider narrowing cannot pass.

alter table plm.source_resolution

alter table plm.source_resolution

comment on column plm.source_resolution.source_system is
  'Durable source vocabulary. A bare licensor token where the licensor has one portal and '
  'one ID space (paramount, nbcu, wildbrain); a licensor_portal token where either side is '
  'shared (disney_opa, disney_dcpvault, lucasfilm_dcpvault, marvel_dcpvault, '
  'twentieth_century_dcpvault); and warner:<source_namespace>, because a Warner source ID is '
  'unique only within its portal namespace. The Warner namespace must be present and '
  'non-blank: warner: with an empty or whitespace-only namespace is refused, because it names '
  'no source namespace and cannot be resolved back to a capture. Pinned by '
  'source_resolution_source_system_supported_chk.';

-- =====================================================================================
-- Self-verification.
--
-- BEHAVIOUR, NOT TEXT. Matching a substring of pg_get_constraintdef would pass for a
-- constraint that accepts everything and for one left NOT VALID, so the vocabulary is proved
-- by REAL INSERTS raising a REAL SQLSTATE.
--
-- THE PROBE IS A LIKE-COPY, NOT THE DURABLE TABLE. The migration verification cost guard
-- (scripts/check-migration-verify-cost.mjs, issue #1285) refuses a verification block that
-- names a plm object in a read-or-write context, and it is right to: a bounded probe must not
-- put a row, however briefly, into a governed durable-decision table inside the apply
-- transaction. `create temporary table ... (like ... including constraints including defaults)`
-- copies the CHECK constraints AS THE CATALOGUE HOLDS THEM at this instant, under their own
-- names, so the expressions exercised below are the deployed expressions. DEFAULTS are
-- included because two NOT NULL timestamp columns are only satisfiable through their defaults.
-- The copy is proved complete before it is trusted. The temporary table is ON COMMIT DROP.
--
-- A NOT VALID constraint would still reject new inserts, so behaviour alone cannot see it.
-- convalidated is therefore pinned in the catalogue alongside the constraint's identity.
--
-- MUTATION TEST. A narrowing block that always passes is the failure mode here, so step 0
-- proves the probe can tell the two expressions apart: it asserts that every value this file
-- newly refuses WAS accepted by the previous expression, restated literally. If the old
-- expression rejected them the block stops -- which would mean these probes were never testing
-- this change at all.
