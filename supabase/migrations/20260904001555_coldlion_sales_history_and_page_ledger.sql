-- Issue #2173 - ColdLion landing unit 3: sales-history redesign and the stage/page
-- completion ledger. Tracker #2081; plan `plan_coldlion_landing_schema_completion.md`
-- §9 Step 4. Claim #2181 reserves version 20260904001555 and exactly these objects:
--
--   coldlion.window_ledger                 (repaired in place - stage/division/page scope)
--   coldlion.history_page_ledger           (new)
--   coldlion.order_history_line            (replaced by forward migration)
--   coldlion.order_history_component       (replaced by forward migration)
--   coldlion.order_history_invoice_ref     (new)
--   coldlion.order_history_pick_ticket_ref (new)
--
-- The three trigger functions created here exist only to enforce contracts of those two
-- ledger tables that no CHECK constraint can express, because they span two rows or two
-- tables. They are part of the declared tables, not separately claimed objects.
--
-- EVIDENCE THIS MIGRATION IS BUILT ON (live, 2026-09-02; #2081 comment 5519573718)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  1. THE VENDOR SILENTLY CAPS PAGES. `GET /orderHistory?...&size=2000&page=0` returned
--     `size=200` in the envelope with no error at all. A loader that asks for one big
--     page and trusts its own request gets 200 rows and believes it has the window.
--     Both the requested and the returned page size are therefore recorded per page,
--     and a window can only be called loaded once its pages are proven contiguous.
--  2. BOTH HISTORY FEEDS RETURN A SPRING `Page` ENVELOPE - `content, first, last,
--     number, numberOfElements, size, sort, totalElements, totalPages` - even though
--     `/v2/api-docs` declares them as raw arrays. 14 of the 16 GET feeds type their 200
--     response as bare {"type":"object"}. THE SPEC IS STALE DOCUMENTATION, NOT A
--     CONTRACT: the loader's unknown-field refusal must key off a SAMPLED SHAPE and
--     never off `/api-docs`. Nothing here is built to the spec.
--  3. `coldlion.window_ledger` as applied had `endpoint, company_code, window_from,
--     window_to, state, attempt_count, last_run_id, row_count` and NO stage code, NO
--     division scope and NO page number. It could not express a stage-scoped or a
--     multi-page window, which is why repairing it belongs to this issue and is a hard
--     prerequisite for production history (#2174) rather than a sibling of it.
--  4. A `fromDate`/`toDate` span wider than seven days returns HTTP 400. The fixed
--     seven-day grid already enforced on this table is mandatory, not an optimisation.
--  5. `OrderHistory` carries `merchGroup01`-`merchGroup06` only. The 14-slot rule is
--     item-side and is deliberately NOT applied to sales history.
--
-- SOURCE RULES APPLIED (docs/business-rules-erp-data.md §10, verified 2026-09-01 on
-- 1,823 live rows across 409 orders)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--  * §10.5 The natural key is the four-part (salesOrderNo, salesOrderLineNo, itemNo,
--    subItemNo): zero duplicates across the corpus. The superseded
--    (salesOrderNo, itemNo, labelCode) design collided as soon as the vendor exposed
--    the real line number. `(salesOrderNo, salesOrderLineNo)` alone repeats on 179
--    groups and is a grouping candidate only - it is NOT business identity and is not
--    described as one anywhere here.
--  * §10.1/§10.2 The API never returns the parent line. It returns it EXPLODED, one row
--    per component SKU, with the parent's totals repeated on every row. A repeated
--    parent total is a header field, not a multiplication: it is stored once, on the
--    parent version, and never summed across components.
--  * §10.3 `orderQty`/`invoiceQty` are already per SKU; `lineQty`/`lineInvoiceQty` are
--    parent totals. Per-design quantities therefore live on the component.
--  * §10.4 `salesOrderLineNo` = 0 is the prepack-explosion marker, not missing data.
--    That is exactly why the line number is constrained >= 0 and not > 0.
--  * §10.7 `invoiceNoString`, `invoiceDateString` and `pickTicketNoString` are
--    COMMA-SEPARATED LISTS. Typing one as an integer truncates or fails. The original
--    string is preserved verbatim AND split into ordered child rows.
--  * §10.8 An invoice number does not prove the row was invoiced - 58 sampled rows have
--    a pick ticket and no invoice, 336 have neither. Fulfilment state is read from the
--    quantities. No document type is inferred and none is stored.
--
-- OWNER DECISIONS: `docs/coldlion-field-decisions-20260819.csv` holds the orderHistory
-- dispositions. D2 (line-level merch groups are item attributes) is narrowed by D14
-- (2026-09-01) to NON-PREPACK rows only: `merchGroup01`-`06` VARY per component on an
-- exploded prepack row, so they are kept at COMPONENT grain here and appear nowhere at
-- line grain. D5 (no per-row raw archive) is why an omitted field is unrecoverable
-- without re-pulling history, and it is why the document-list strings - marked `ignore`
-- on 2026-08-19 from a sample in which they were always empty, then shown by the
-- 1,823-row corpus to carry real comma-separated lists on 31 rows - are ingested.
--
-- NO foreign key from either sales-history table to coldlion.item_header: discontinued
-- historical items are legitimately absent from the current item master. No FK into
-- core.*. No application grants. No raw column (D5). No loader: its runtime is not this
-- issue's to decide.

--
-- A stage-less /prodHistory request returned ONLY `ISS` rows for a window that also held
-- `INTRAN` rows, with no error and a plausible-looking total. So a window is not an
-- (endpoint, company, dates) fact: it is an (endpoint, company, division scope, stage
-- scope, dates) fact, and an unscoped pull is a DIFFERENT window from a scoped one, not
-- a superset of it.
--
-- Both new scope columns are nullable because an unscoped pull is a real, legitimate
-- request shape. Postgres's default UNIQUE treats every NULL as distinct, so an
-- unscoped window could be recorded twice under the default rule. Every identity
-- constraint added here is therefore NULLS NOT DISTINCT: replaying an unscoped
-- stage/division cannot duplicate a window or a page.

comment on table coldlion.window_ledger is
  'One row per 7-day window per capped history endpoint (/prodHistory, /orderHistory), scoped by company, optional division and - for production history - the required ISS/INTRAN/REC stage. States: pending, running, loaded, failed. Windows advance by exactly 7 days on the grid anchored at 2019-01-01; a wider fromDate/toDate span returns HTTP 400 from the vendor. CORRECTION (issue #2173, live evidence 2026-09-02): this table previously stated that both history endpoints are unpaged. That is WRONG. They return a Spring Page envelope and silently cap the page size at 200 - a requested size=2000 came back as size=200 with no error. Completion is therefore proven by coldlion.history_page_ledger and never by one sync_run row; see the window_ledger_completion_guard trigger. A stage-less /prodHistory request returns only ISS rows while INTRAN rows exist, so an unscoped pull is a DIFFERENT window from a scoped one. Issue #1184 phase 1; fixed grid #1195; stage/page scope #2173.';

-- 2. coldlion.history_page_ledger - one row per page of one window
-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- This table is the structural answer to objection U6. Because the vendor silently
-- replaces the requested page size, the only honest evidence that a window is complete
-- is a page-by-page record: every page from 0 through the page the vendor itself
-- flagged `last`, each one succeeded, and the row counts adding up to the totals the
-- vendor reported. `requested_page_size` and `returned_page_size` are stored separately
-- precisely so the silent substitution is visible in the data rather than inferred.

comment on table coldlion.order_history_line is
  'One version of one ColdLion sales-order line. Append-only. The vendor never returns this row: it returns the line exploded into component SKUs with the parent totals repeated on each, so the loader synthesises one parent per distinct (salesOrderNo, salesOrderLineNo, itemNo, line_source_hash) and asserts field constancy only WITHIN that full group. ORDER + LINE ALONE IS NOT BUSINESS IDENTITY - it repeats on 179 groups of the 1,823-row corpus because ColdLion reassigns line numbers across documents (docs/business-rules-erp-data.md §10.5). line_source_hash covers only the line-grain projection: every approved field proven constant across components, excluding sub*, the component item, per-design quantities and prices, component taxonomy and the document-list tokens. Differing projections remain separate versions and are never merged. NO FK to coldlion.item_header: discontinued historical items are legitimately absent from the current item master. Merch-group columns appear only at component grain (D2 as narrowed by D14). Retention follows the deterministic newest-three contract; the initial backfill retains its single baseline version.

  'One component design of one sales-order line version, with a mandatory FK to that version - every component has exactly one parent. On a non-prepack row there is exactly one component and sub_item_no is NULL. order_qty and invoice_qty are ColdLion''s own per-SKU numbers and are the ones to read; a prepack row with order_qty = 0 against a non-zero parent line_qty is the rounding artefact of a partial prepack (§10.6), not an empty line. An invoice number never proves the row was invoiced - fulfilment state comes from the quantities (§10.8) - and no document type is inferred or stored. Issue #2173.';
comment on column coldlion.order_history_component.order_qty is
