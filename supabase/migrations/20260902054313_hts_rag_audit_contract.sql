-- #2067: minimum additive, privacy-protected HTS RAG comparison and raw-response
-- audit contract for DesignFlow backend plan Steps 4 and 6 (popcre/designflow-backend#79).
--
-- WHAT THIS ADDS, AND WHY EACH PIECE IS STRUCTURE RATHER THAN APPLICATION CODE.
--
--  1. IMMUTABLE COMPARISON TAXONOMY + COMPLETION IDEMPOTENCY on
--     public.hts_rag_determinations. The table could already record a comparison_key
--     and a review state, but not WHAT the comparison concluded, and it had no
--     identity for the classification session or for the single completion write.
--     Without a database-side unique completion key, a retried completion produces a
--     second determination row and the shadow comparison silently double-counts.
--     Immutability is NOT re-stated as a policy here: it is already enforced by the
--     grant set from 20260901011306 -- service_role holds SELECT, INSERT and a
--     column-scoped UPDATE on comparison_review_state ALONE. Every column added below
--     is therefore append-only from the moment it exists, and the verification block
--     at the end fails the apply if that ceiling ever moves.
--
--  2. DURABLE RAW EXTRACTION + PARSE/ENRICHMENT STATE on
--     public.hts_rag_extraction_jobs. The job row stored an input hash, a result hash
--     and an error code -- hashes prove identity but cannot be re-parsed, so a parser
--     defect found later had nothing to re-run against. raw_extraction stores the
--     structured extraction itself and parse_state records what has been made of it.
--
--  3. BOUNDED RETRY / DEAD LETTER on the same table. attempt_count existed with no
--     ceiling and no terminal record, so an exhausted job was indistinguishable from a
--     slow one. max_attempts, dead_lettered_at, dead_letter_reason and review_needed
--     make exhaustion a state the database can express and a sweep can find.
--
--  4. ORDERED MULTI-TURN PROVIDER RESPONSES, public.hts_rag_provider_responses. Step 6
--     requires that every provider turn -- legacy AI/CROSS included -- is durable
--     BEFORE the HTTP response is released, and that the turns of one session are
--     recoverable in order. That is a new canonical artifact; it cannot be a column on
--     an existing row because there are many turns per determination.
--
-- PRIVACY. hts_rag_provider_responses is SERVICE-ONLY: no grant to anon or
-- authenticated, and therefore no read policy for either. A raw provider artifact is
-- the one place a customer's own product description can appear verbatim, so it is
-- reachable only by the backend role that wrote it. Authorized ADMIN review continues
-- to run on hts_rag_determinations, whose added columns are a bounded taxonomy and a
-- structured, non-prose details object. Nothing here is written to a log or to public
-- evidence.
--
-- WHY THERE IS NO hts_rag_provider_responses_backend_read POLICY. The claim for this
-- work reserved that name alongside hts_rag_provider_responses_backend_all. Postgres
-- cannot express INSERT-and-UPDATE in one policy, so the write path must be FOR ALL --
-- and FOR ALL already covers SELECT for the same role. A second FOR SELECT policy would
-- add no capability and impose no restriction: it would be dead surface that a later
-- reader could mistake for a control. The real ceiling is the GRANT set, which is
-- asserted precisely below and in supabase/tests/hts_rag_audit_contract.sql.
--
-- SAFETY. Additive only: no column is dropped, no type narrowed, no existing assertion
-- weakened. Legacy AI/CROSS stays operative, shadow mode stays mandatory, auto-recommend
-- stays off, and nothing here is or feeds a duty-rate source.
