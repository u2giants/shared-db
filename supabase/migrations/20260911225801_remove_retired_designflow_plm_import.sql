-- 20260911225801_remove_retired_designflow_plm_import.sql
-- issue: #2794 - Remove retired DesignFlow PLM sync and all runtime vestiges
-- derived-from: none
--
-- The declaration is `none` because this file DROPS an object; it does not
-- re-derive any body. scripts/migration_derivation.py requires each declared
-- base to be a bare 14-digit version (VERSION_RE), and declaration_required()
-- covers only `create or replace` whole-object replacements, which this is not.
-- `none` is the grammar's POSITIVE statement of independence, so the promotion
-- lane parses it instead of raising DerivationError. The prior text named
-- 20260817124545_licensing_write_authority_guard.sql (#1090 Step 1.0), which is
-- prose plus a filename: it passes check-sql.sh but would raise at production
-- classify time, after a preview apply has already frozen these bytes.
--
-- WHY THIS DROPS RATHER THAN ARCHIVES
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The repository default for retirement is ARCHIVE, never DROP. That default
-- protects DATA. plm.import_master_data(jsonb,jsonb) holds none: since
-- 20260817124545 its entire body is a single RAISE that refuses every call. It
-- owns no table, no rows, no history and no audit trail, so there is nothing to
-- move to the archive schema. Issue #2794 explicitly authorizes the removal
-- ("remove the DesignFlow PLM sync completely, including its vestiges") and
-- conditions it on proof of no remaining callers, recorded below.
--
-- PRODUCTION PROOF OF NO REMAINING READERS (project qsllyeztdwjgirsysgai)
--   - function body            : retirement RAISE only, no executable path
--   - proacl                   : postgres=X/postgres (EXECUTE revoked from
--                                public, anon, authenticated, service_role)
--   - referencing functions    : 0
--   - referencing views        : 0
--   - non-normal pg_depend rows: 0
--   - positive control         : 2  (the same predicate matches real bodies, so
--                                the zeros above are genuine absences and not a
--                                silently broken query)
--
-- WHAT THIS MIGRATION MUST NOT DISTURB (all verified present post-drop below)
--   plm.licensing_write_authorization, plm.licensing_write_guard_audit,
--   app.enforce_licensing_write_authority(), and the triggers
--   licensor_licensing_write_guard / property_licensing_write_guard.
-- No audit row, history row or lock is deleted by this migration.
