-- public.bulk_operation_runs -- append-only run history for PopDAM bulk operations.
-- Issue #2439 ("the nightly style-group rebuild failed and cron reported success").
-- Claim issue #2443, reserved version 20260906143443.
-- derived-from: none
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
-- ---------------
-- Bulk-operation state is not a table today. It is ONE JSONB object per operation
-- inside public.admin_config under key 'BULK_OPERATIONS', and every writer replaces
-- the whole object (see 20260819011639 and 20260820142402). That store answers
-- "what is the state NOW" and can never answer "when did this last succeed", because
-- each run erases the previous one.
--
-- On 2026-09-06 the nightly style-group rebuild died 8.2 seconds in having processed
-- zero assets, while cron job 7 reported `succeeded` for that same run and for the
-- previous ten nights. Both records were truthful: job 7's body is
-- `select public.queue_nightly_rebuild_style_groups();`, so cron measures the ENQUEUE,
-- not the rebuild an external worker performs afterwards. The only surface that could
-- have contradicted the green tick -- the operation's own outcome -- had already been
-- overwritten. "How long has this been failing?" was, and is, unanswerable from what
-- we store.
--
-- This table is that missing record: one immutable row per terminal outcome, so a
-- run's failure survives the next run and an alert can be written against the WORKER's
-- outcome instead of the scheduler's.
--
-- WHAT THIS IS NOT
-- ----------------
-- ADDITIVE ONLY. It creates one table with its own indexes, policies and grants and
-- nothing else. It does NOT alter public.admin_config (whose shape is unchanged and
-- which remains the live-state store), does not touch public.update_bulk_operation,
-- public.update_bulk_operations_batch, public.queue_nightly_rebuild_style_groups,
-- app.rebuild_style_groups_batch, or any cron entry, and it seeds no rows. Nothing
-- writes this table yet: the PopDAM worker gains an insert at the end of each run in
-- its own repository. Until then the table is empty, and an empty run history must be
-- read as "not instrumented yet", never as "no failures".
--
-- APPEND-ONLY IS ENFORCED BY PRIVILEGE, NOT BY TRIGGER
-- ----------------------------------------------------
-- No role -- not even service_role -- is granted UPDATE or DELETE here. A history that
-- an ordinary writer can edit is not history. The grants below are deliberately
-- INSERT + SELECT only; the table owner (postgres) can still correct the table by an
-- explicit, reviewed migration, which is the intended escape hatch. A trigger-based
-- guard was considered and rejected: it would add a function object outside the
-- objects this change claims, and it can be dropped by the same caller it constrains.
--
-- IDENTITY AND IDEMPOTENCE
-- ------------------------
-- (operation, run_id) is unique. The worker already carries a run_id per run, and a
-- retrying appender must not be able to double-record one run. run_id is text so a
-- uuid, an ISO timestamp or a provider job id all land without a lossy cast.

create table if not exists public.bulk_operation_runs (
