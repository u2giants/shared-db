-- Issue #2123: give the two Tier-2 licensor character source tables the same
-- core.character promotion contract the Tier-1 tables already carry.
--
-- derived-from: none
--
-- WHY. docs/core-character-backfill-source-decision-20260902.md sec.3 sorts the
-- licensor character source tables by one question: does the table carry a
-- core_character_id column pointing at core.character? Tier 1 does, so a
-- resolution can be recorded against the row that produced it. Tier 2 does not,
-- so plm.wb_character_normalized and plm.wildbrain_character cannot be promoted
-- at all until a structural migration adds one. This is that migration.
--
-- WHAT SHAPE. The contract is copied from plm.opa_character
-- (20260814040000_opa_property_character_normalize.sql), which is the Tier-1
-- table that carries the resolver-and-timestamp audit check. Same columns, same
-- status vocabulary, same check body, same partial index. A resolution is only
-- real if it names both a target and a resolver. Do not route around that check
-- with a direct insert into core.character.
--
-- NOTE ON THE FOREIGN KEY. 20260823133150 dropped the Tier-1 core_character_id
-- foreign keys when it dropped core.character, and 20260829004145 recreated
-- core.character without restoring them. This migration declares the foreign key
-- as the Tier-1 contract was originally authored, on its own two tables only.
-- Restoring the Tier-1 foreign keys is a separate object claim and is not
-- attempted here.
--
-- STRUCTURE ONLY. No row is inserted, updated or promoted by this file. Every
-- existing row lands on the default resolution_status 'unresolved' with a null
-- target, a null resolver and a null timestamp, which the new check accepts.
--
-- VOCABULARY CHOICE, CONFIRMED. docs/core-character-backfill-source-decision-
-- 20260902.md sec.4 groups plm.opa_character, plm.pmt_character and
-- plm.nbcu_character together, but only opa_character's vocabulary and audit
-- check require a named resolver and timestamp; pmt/nbcu use a looser
-- matched/no_match pair with no resolver requirement. This migration follows
-- opa_character on purpose, and the verify block below checks exact
-- definition text (default, both CHECK bodies, index predicate) rather than
-- presence-by-name, so a future edit cannot silently drift onto the looser
-- shape without failing the migration.
