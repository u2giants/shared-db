-- Issue #2094: ColdLion raw landing Step 2 — the six master landing tables.
-- derived-from: none
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE ACTUALLY CREATES, AND WHY IT IS SMALLER THAN THE ISSUE.
--
-- Issue #2094 asks for the `coldlion` schema and the six master landing tables
-- of docs/coldlion-raw-landing-schema-design.md §3.1. Four of the six, and the
-- schema itself, are ALREADY ON main and were verified before this file was
-- written:
--
--   * schema `coldlion`               — 20260818232639 (issue #1184 phase 1)
--   * coldlion.merch_group_header     — 20260825023430 (issue #1184 phases 2-6)
--   * coldlion.merch_group_detail     — 20260825023430, already carrying the
--                                       mandatory FOUR-part natural key
--   * coldlion.customer               — 20260825023430
--   * coldlion.vendor                 — 20260825023430
--
-- `coldlion.season` and `coldlion.salesperson` were explicitly deferred by
-- docs/plan_coldlion-landing-phases-2-6.md §"NOT in this plan" ("seasons,
-- salespersons ... phase 6 as consumers ask"). #2094 is that ask. This file
-- therefore ADDS exactly those two tables, re-asserts the schema idempotently,
-- and then verifies all six as one set so the six-table contract of #2094 is
-- enforced by the apply rather than assumed. Nothing pre-existing is altered
-- or dropped.
--
-- LAYER RULES RE-STATED, BECAUSE THIS FILE IS BOUND BY THEM.
--   * This layer NEVER interprets. One table per grain; columns are named after
--     the ColdLion endpoint fields, snake_cased, with no renaming into our own
--     vocabulary and no derived, resolved or matched columns.
--   * NO foreign key leaves the `coldlion` schema, and in particular none
--     reaches `core.*` or any curated table. `run_id` references
--     `coldlion.sync_run`, which is inside this schema, exactly as every other
--     landing table already does.
--   * Current-state behaviour: the common landing columns plus `first_seen_at`
--     / `last_seen_at`, and `source_hash` computed over the COMPLETE fetched
--     record before projection (SHA-256; one hash algorithm across the schema).
--   * No per-row `raw` archive (owner decision D5). Complete before/after
--     payloads live only in `coldlion.change_log` when a row actually changes.
--
-- COLUMN PROJECTION — DELIBERATELY MINIMAL, AND WHY.
-- docs/coldlion-erp-api-reference.md documents `/seasons` by companyCode,
-- divisionCode, seasonCode and `/salespersons` by companyCode,
-- salesPersonCode, lastName. Neither endpoint appears in
-- docs/coldlion-field-decisions-20260819.csv, so there is no owner-reviewed
-- field census for them. Rather than invent plausible columns, this file lands
-- only the documented fields plus the two ColdLion master timestamps that every
-- other landing master carries. Additional columns are additive and belong to
-- the loader step, once a live probe produces a field census the owner has
-- reviewed. Guessing here would launder invention into something that reads as
-- authoritative, which is the one failure this layer exists to prevent.
--
-- SECURITY POSTURE — STATED, THEN ENFORCED BELOW.
-- This is a raw landing layer and NO application may read it directly. Row
-- level security is ENABLED on both new tables and NO policy is created: the
-- layer is CLOSED to applications, not row-filtered for them. All privileges
-- are revoked from PUBLIC, `anon` and `authenticated`; only `service_role`
-- (the loader, the DB admin tool and audits) is granted access. The verification
-- block at the end fails the apply if that posture is missing or regressed on
-- any of the six master tables.
--
-- Structure only. This migration loads no rows.
