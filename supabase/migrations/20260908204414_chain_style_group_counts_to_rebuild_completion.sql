-- Issue #2440 - chain nightly-reconcile-sg-asset-counts to the rebuild's COMPLETION
-- instead of the fixed clock `45 3 * * *`.
-- Depends on #2439, merged to main as 03f917d0dec6e0973e4b9cddd72e02f686a19e0c.

-- Claim #2608 reserves version 20260908204414 and these objects:
--
--   function public.queue_nightly_rebuild_style_groups()      (replaced in place)
--   function public.refresh_style_group_counts_batch(uuid[])  (declared, NOT touched --
--                                                              see "WHAT IS NOT TOUCHED")
--
-- derived-from: the baseline body of queue_nightly_rebuild_style_groups() carried in
-- supabase/ci-bootstrap/010_pre_adoption_baseline.sql. That function has no prior file
-- under supabase/migrations/; the baseline copy was its only source in this repository,
-- and the body below is re-derived from it line by line, not merged into. This migration
-- takes ownership of the function and removes that baseline copy -- see "THE CI BASELINE
-- COPY IS REMOVED BY THIS CHANGE" below.
--
-- THE DEFECT (as recorded on #2440)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--   jobid 6   45 3 * * *   nightly-reconcile-sg-asset-counts
--                          SELECT public.refresh_style_group_counts_batch(array_agg(id))
--                          FROM public.style_groups;
--   jobid 7   0  6 * * *   nightly-rebuild-style-groups
--                          SELECT public.queue_nightly_rebuild_style_groups();
--
-- Both schedules are UTC. Job 6 recomputes every style group's asset count 2 h 15 m
-- BEFORE the rebuild that decides which assets belong to which group. The counts are
-- therefore always measured against yesterday's membership: every group whose membership
-- moves in the nightly rebuild carries a stale count for a full day, and the number is
-- never wrong in a visible way - it is plausible, just old.
--
-- Job 6 is also unbatched despite its name. `array_agg(id) FROM style_groups` hands
-- ~10.9k ids to one call of a function whose own statement_timeout is 30s, and that call
-- was measured at ~94.9s average over 8 calls (#2214 evidence). It is the most expensive
-- statement in the nightly window and it is spent on input the rebuild is about to
-- invalidate.
--
-- WHY THIS IS NOT "MOVE JOB 6 TO A LATER HOUR"
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The rebuild is ASYNCHRONOUS. Job 7 only ENQUEUES; an external PopDAM worker drives the
-- work and records its state in
-- `public.admin_config -> 'BULK_OPERATIONS' -> 'rebuild-style-groups'`. The 2026-09-06
-- run recorded on #2440 (run_id ba9ce32e-253f-45a9-ab4f-944cb260354c, 135,300 processed)
-- took 2 h 09 m wall clock, and the duration moves with data volume. Replacing one
-- hardcoded clock time with another reproduces this defect at a different hour.
--
-- WHAT THIS MIGRATION DOES - THREE THINGS
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- (1) DELETES job 6's schedule. `nightly-reconcile-sg-asset-counts` is unscheduled. The
--     reconcile no longer runs on a clock at all. This is the change the issue asks for
--     in one line, and everything else exists to make it safe.
--
-- (2) TURNS job 7 INTO A 10-MINUTE POLL (`*/10 * * * *`) over the same function. The
--     jobname `nightly-rebuild-style-groups` and the command
--     `select public.queue_nightly_rebuild_style_groups();` are deliberately UNCHANGED:
--     #2439's evidence, the admin tooling and the operator runbooks all name that job,
--     and renaming it to match the new cadence would silently break every reference for
--     a cosmetic gain. The function, not the schedule, now decides what happens.
--
-- (3) REWRITES queue_nightly_rebuild_style_groups() as a three-armed driver. At most one
--     arm fires per invocation, and every arm is gated on state, never on the clock alone.
--
-- THE THREE ARMS
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ARM 1 - ENQUEUE. Preserves the retired `0 6 * * *` semantics under a 10-minute poll:
--   fire only at or after 06:00 UTC, only once per UTC day, and only when the operation
--   is not already 'running' or 'queued'. The once-per-day gate reads `last_enqueued_at`
--   from this function's OWN marker object (see "WHERE THE MARKER LIVES"), not from the
--   operation state, because the worker overwrites the operation state wholesale.
--
-- ARM 2 - CHAINED RECONCILE. Fires when the operation's status is exactly 'completed'
--   AND its run_id differs from the last run this function already reconciled.
--     * `= 'completed'`, never "the status changed": a run that ends 'interrupted' or
--       'failed' must NOT trigger a ~98s recompute against membership the rebuild never
--       finished touching. Requirement 1 on #2440.
--     * Keyed on run_id, never on status alone: a status left standing at 'completed'
--       would otherwise re-reconcile every ten minutes forever. Requirement 2 on #2440.
--
-- ARM 3 - THE FLOOR. Fires when the last reconcile of any kind is older than 7 days, or
--   has never happened. Requirement 3 on #2440, and it is not optional: the failure mode
--   this change INTRODUCES is silence. If the rebuild stops reaching 'completed', the
--   counts simply stop refreshing and nothing anywhere says so - strictly worse than
--   today's stale-but-running counts. The floor bounds that silence at 7 days, and the
--   marker object makes it observable rather than inferable (see "THE DETECTOR").
--
-- BATCHING - REQUIREMENT 4
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Both reconcile arms walk public.style_groups in ordered chunks of 500 ids and call
-- public.refresh_style_group_counts_batch once per chunk. The single ~10.9k-element array
-- is gone. This matters for more than tidiness: statement_timeout is enforced PER
-- STATEMENT, and that function carries `SET statement_timeout = '30s'`, so the old
-- single-array call was one statement racing a 30s cap that a 94.9s workload cannot win.
-- Each chunk now gets its own timer. Chunking does not shorten the transaction and is not
-- claimed to: the whole driver invocation remains one transaction.
--
-- WHERE THE MARKER LIVES, AND WHY NOT IN THE OPERATION STATE
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The marker is a SEPARATE top-level BULK_OPERATIONS key,
-- `admin_config -> 'BULK_OPERATIONS' -> 'style-group-counts-reconcile'`.
--
-- It cannot live inside the 'rebuild-style-groups' object. public.update_bulk_operation
-- (20260819011639) REPLACES that object with a value derived from the caller's payload on
-- every write, so any key this function added there would be erased by the worker's very
-- next progress update - and an idempotency marker that the thing it guards can delete is
-- not a marker. The worker never reads or writes the 'style-group-counts-reconcile' key.
--
-- No new table, column, type or index is created for it. A dedicated marker table was
-- considered and rejected: it would be an object outside this claim, and admin_config is
-- already the store this function writes.
--
-- THE DETECTOR (requirement 3, second half)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The marker records `last_reconciled_at`, `last_reconciled_run_id`,
-- `last_reconcile_reason` ('rebuild_completed' | 'floor'), `last_reconcile_rows_written`,
-- `last_reconcile_trigger_status` and `last_enqueued_at`. "When did the counts last
-- refresh, and why" becomes a single read of one JSONB key instead of an inference from
-- cron.job_run_details - which cannot answer it, because cron measures the ENQUEUE and
-- reports success for it. An alert on `last_reconciled_at` older than 48h is now
-- writable; wiring that alert into PopDAM is application work and is NOT done here.
--
-- LOCKING - A REAL COST, STATED PLAINLY
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The advisory lock `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('BULK_OPERATIONS'))` is taken exactly
-- as the baseline body took it, and it is transaction-scoped, so a reconcile arm holds it
-- for the duration of the reconcile - order ~98s, once per night. Every other
-- BULK_OPERATIONS writer (update_bulk_operation, update_bulk_operations_batch) blocks for
-- that window. This is accepted rather than worked around:
--   * The lock is what makes the run_id marker safe. Two overlapping poll invocations
--     cannot both read "not yet reconciled" and both fire the recompute.
--   * The window follows the rebuild reporting 'completed', so the worker is not mid-run
--     on this operation.
--   * Releasing it early would need a session-scoped lock and an explicit unlock, which
--     reopens exactly the double-fire race the lock exists to close.
-- If BULK_OPERATIONS contention ever becomes real, the fix is a separate advisory key for
-- the reconcile, which touches more objects than this claim holds.
--
-- ADMIN_CONFIG: #2440's scope block lists `table public.admin_config` under reads. This
-- function already WRITES that table today, in the baseline body, and continues to write
-- exactly the same one row (key = 'BULK_OPERATIONS'). No new table is written; the
-- read-only wording in the scope block understates the pre-existing behaviour, and it is
-- named here rather than left to be discovered.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT TOUCHED
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- public.refresh_style_group_counts_batch(uuid[]) is DECLARED in claim #2608 and is
-- deliberately NOT replaced. Requirement 4 asks that the CALL SITE stop passing every
-- group in one array, and the call site is this function. That function's body already
-- carries #2214's change predicate, which is the reason a converged reconcile writes
-- nothing; re-deriving and re-issuing that body here would risk regressing it for no
-- behavioural gain. Over-declaring a write is safe (the lane guard requires the
-- migration's objects to be a SUBSET of the claim's writes); under-declaring is not.
--
-- Also untouched: public.rebuild_style_groups_batch, public.update_bulk_operation,
-- public.update_bulk_operations_batch, public.bulk_operation_runs, the shape of
-- public.admin_config, and every table, column, index, constraint, trigger, policy and
-- grant in the database. No row of style_groups or assets is written by this migration.
--
-- The worker-signalled mechanism (#2440 option A) remains the better long-term shape and
-- is NOT foreclosed: it is PopDAM application work in another repository, and when the
-- worker calls the reconcile as its own final stage, ARM 2 simply stops finding an
-- unreconciled completed run while the floor keeps the safety net. Nothing here has to be
-- undone for that.
--
-- THE CI BASELINE COPY IS REMOVED BY THIS CHANGE
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- supabase/ci-bootstrap/010_pre_adoption_baseline.sql carried the pre-adoption body of
-- queue_nightly_rebuild_style_groups() because no migration in this repository created
-- that function. This migration creates it, so the baseline copy is deleted here.
--
-- This is not cosmetic. The "Database Contract Tests" lane applies the baseline BETWEEN
-- the two migration replay passes (see .github/workflows/database-contract-tests.yml,
-- "WHY BETWEEN THE PASSES AND NOT BEFORE PASS 1"). A migration that replaces a baseline
-- routine and SUCCEEDS in pass 1 is therefore silently overwritten by the baseline's own
-- CREATE OR REPLACE, and the suite then tests the pre-adoption body while every catalog
-- and cron contract still passes. That is exactly what happened to this file: the
-- requirement-1 contract failed because the OLD clock-driven body was the one running.
-- The baseline's own instructions name this remedy -- "a migration has started creating
-- an object the baseline also creates. Delete it from the baseline rather than leaving
-- both." The two grants blocks are left in place; they are idempotent no-ops against the
-- function this migration creates.
--
-- ROLLBACK: a new forward migration restoring the pre-adoption body, which is preserved
-- in this repository's git history of supabase/ci-bootstrap/010_pre_adoption_baseline.sql
-- immediately before this migration's commit, re-scheduling job 7 at `0 6 * * *` and
-- re-creating `nightly-reconcile-sg-asset-counts` at `45 3 * * *` with its original
-- command. The marker key can be left in admin_config harmlessly.
