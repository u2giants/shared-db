-- Issue #2576. DCP full-population matching: approved cross-copy identities
-- still display unmapped.
-- derived-from: 20260907200221, 20260902053756
--
-- WHAT IS WRONG
-- -------------
-- plm.dcp_opa_property_resolution keys every decision on the EXACT retained
-- copy (source_system, source_table, source_property_id). DCP Vault landed the
-- same Creative property into three retained tables, so one business identity
-- owns up to three independent decision ledgers. Read from production
-- (project ref qsllyeztdwjgirsysgai) on 2026-09-10:
--
--   select r.resolution_id, r.source_table, r.decision_version, r.approval_status,
--          r.creative_decision_state,
--          (select count(*) from plm.dcp_opa_property_resolution_member m
--             where m.resolution_id = r.resolution_id) as members
--     from plm.dcp_opa_property_resolution r
--    where r.source_property_id = 'dcpvault:properties/ba/bambi'
--    order by r.source_table, r.decision_version;
--
--   plm.dcp_property            v1 approved unmapped 0 members
--   plm.lucasfilm_dcp_property  v1 approved unmapped 0 members
--   plm.marvel_dcp_property     v1 pending  (null)   1 member
--   plm.marvel_dcp_property     v2 approved (null)   1 member
--
-- The identity IS mapped -- an approved terminal decision with one member
-- exists -- yet the reader, keyed on the exact copy, renders the
-- plm.dcp_property row as unmapped.
--
-- WHY THE STABLE KEY IS THE ID OWN NAMESPACE, NOT THE LANDING TABLE
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------
-- The grouping is derived, not assumed. Cross-tabbing every retained copy:
--
--   select source_property_id, count(distinct source_table) as tables,
--          string_agg(distinct source_system||' / '||source_table, ' ; ')
--     from plm.dcp_opa_property_resolution
--    group by 1 having count(distinct source_table) > 1;
--
--   'dcpvault:properties/ba/bambi' -> 3 tables: disney_dcpvault/plm.dcp_property ;
--       lucasfilm_dcpvault/plm.lucasfilm_dcp_property ;
--       marvel_dcpvault/plm.marvel_dcp_property        (SAME business Creative)
--   '100'                          -> 2 tables: sega_dsi/plm.sega_property ;
--       wildbrain_dam/source.wildbrain_era             (DIFFERENT businesses)
--
-- So a bare source id must never be grouped across systems: small integer ids
-- collide between licensors. The 'dcpvault:' prefix is the id own emitted
-- namespace, and it partitions exactly -- all 462 dcpvault-namespaced rows
-- belong to the three DCP copies and no other system emits that prefix:
--
--   select (source_property_id like 'dcpvault:%'), source_system, source_table,
--          count(*) from plm.dcp_opa_property_resolution group by 1,2,3;
--   -> true : disney_dcpvault/plm.dcp_property 311
--      true : lucasfilm_dcpvault/plm.lucasfilm_dcp_property 119
--      true : marvel_dcpvault/plm.marvel_dcp_property 32
--
-- Grouping therefore reads the stable DCP source id itself. It never infers
-- from landing-table family, from the non-authoritative Marvel tag, or from a
-- normalized name, and every non-DCP source keeps the exact copy key it has
-- today.
--
-- THE STABLE-IDENTITY CONTRACT (identical in all three functions)
-- --------------------------------------------------------------
--   * Take the newest TERMINAL (approved/rejected) decision of EVERY retained
--     copy of the identity. A later pending proposal is a proposal: it stays in
--     the review queue and can never hide a terminal decision.
--   * Fingerprint each terminal copy by its exact member set (submission
--     source system/table/id).
--   * Two or more copies terminally MAPPED to DIFFERENT member sets is a
--     genuine terminal disagreement: the identity FAILS CLOSED to 'conflict'
--     with no resolution_id, so no mapping is served and the identity stays
--     reviewable. Nothing guesses a winner.
--   * Otherwise a single agreed mapping wins, even when another retained copy
--     merely LACKS a mapping (approved/unmapped): a lack is not a competing
--     authority.
--   * With no mapped copy at all, the newest terminal copy own state stands.
--
--   * The WRITE side is guarded to match. The insert stays copy-keyed, so an
--     approval carrying members is refused when it would introduce a member
--     set that disagrees with a terminal mapping already recorded on another
--     retained copy of the same identity and that no terminal mapping already
--     holds. That is the only way a single-copy screen could have driven a
--     working identity into 'conflict' and un-served a mapping the reviewer
--     never opened. Approving the set an existing terminal mapping already
--     carries stays allowed, so a disagreement is always reconcilable and no
--     identity is ever stranded.
--
-- ACCEPTED RESIDUAL RISKS (recorded, not hidden)
-- ---------------------------------------------
--   * NOT RE-RUNNABLE, BY DESIGN. Every in-place rewrite here refuses unless
--     the current body is exactly the text it was derived from. In the two
--     decide-function rewrites the replacement text ENDS with the needle it
--     replaces, so an exact-once hit count alone cannot tell a fresh body from
--     an already-rewritten one. Each of those blocks therefore ASSERTS FIRST
--     that the marker it installs ('identity_decision_state' in section 3,
--     'would give the stable identity' in section 4) is absent, and only then
--     checks the needle occurs exactly once. supabase_migrations.schema_migrations
--     already runs each version once; the absence assertion is what makes an
--     isolated re-run of a single block fail closed too.
--   * GROUPING IS PREFIX-ONLY, NOT A CLOSED SYSTEM ALLOW-LIST. 'dcpvault:' is
--     the id's own emitted namespace and today all 462 such rows belong to the
--     three DCP copies (census above). Since #2449 dropped the three-table
--     identity check, a future non-DCP loader that emitted a 'dcpvault:'
--     prefix would join the DCP identity. This is accepted rather than fixed
--     here because a source_system allow-list would have to be widened by
--     every new DCP-family load and would silently un-group an identity when
--     it was not, which is the failure this issue exists to remove. The prefix
--     is owned by DCP Vault and no other loader in this repository emits it;
--     a loader that did would be the defect.
--   * TIE ORDERING IS TOTAL, NOT ARBITRARY. Both the per-copy pick and the
--     across-copy pick end in resolution_id desc, and resolution_id is the
--     primary key, so equal decision_version and equal approved_at still order
--     deterministically. Divergent mapped member sets never reach the tie: they
--     fail closed to 'conflict' first.
--   * identity_copies IS DELIBERATELY WIDER ON THE READ SIDE. The queue carries
--     copy_decision_state and member_fingerprint so a reviewer screen can show
--     WHY an identity conflicts; the decide response carries the seven fields a
--     write acknowledgement needs. Both agree on identity_key and
--     identity_decision_state, which is what any caller decides on.
--
-- Append-only decision history, canonical OPA ids, the security-definer
-- licensing-manager gate, least-privilege grants, keyset pagination and the
-- #2449 non-authoritative Marvel-tag exclusion are all unchanged. This
-- migration writes no candidate or result rows.

--    mapped: mapped_fingerprints becomes 2, resolution_id becomes null, and

--    fails closed by design; it must not be possible to reach that state by
--    accident from a single-copy screen.
--
--    The rule refuses rather than guesses, and it never strands an identity:
--    an approval carrying members is refused only when it would INTRODUCE a
--    member set that no terminal mapping of the same stable identity already
--    holds while some other terminal mapping disagrees with it. Approving the
--    set an existing terminal mapping already carries is always allowed (that
--    is how a disagreement is reconciled), an approval with no members is
--    always allowed (a lack of mapping is not a competing authority), and a
--    rejection is always allowed. Non-dcpvault sources keep their exact copy
--    key and are unaffected. Members are compared by the same submission
