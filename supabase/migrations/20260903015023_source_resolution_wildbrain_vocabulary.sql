-- Add WildBrain to the plm.source_resolution source vocabulary.
--
-- Migration: 20260903015023_source_resolution_wildbrain_vocabulary.sql
-- Issue:     u2giants/shared-db #2147
-- Claim:     u2giants/shared-db #2154 -- table plm.source_resolution. Nothing else.
-- derived-from: none
--
-- Depends on (exact 14-digit versions):
--   20260902024541  source_resolution_supported_home -- creates plm.source_resolution and
--                   the constraint this file widens. This migration only ALTERS one
--                   constraint; it re-derives no object body, which is why it declares
--                   `derived-from: none`. If the table is absent this file fails loudly
--                   rather than installing anything.
--   20260819014639  wildbrain_dam_source_landing -- the per-capture WildBrain landing whose
--                   decisions have nowhere durable to live until this value exists. Not a
--                   hard dependency: nothing below reads or references those tables.
--
-- LOADS NO DATA. No row is inserted into plm.source_resolution by this file, and no
-- WildBrain property, character, guide, asset or keyword value appears anywhere in it.
-- u2giants/shared-db is a PUBLIC repository: SCHEMA IN GIT, DATA OUT OF GIT.

-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHY A PLAIN VALUE AND NOT A NAMESPACED PATTERN
--
-- The existing vocabulary is `paramount`, `nbcu`, `disney_opa`, `disney_dcpvault`,
-- `lucasfilm_dcpvault`, `marvel_dcpvault`, `twentieth_century_dcpvault`, plus the LIKE
-- pattern `warner:%`. That pattern is not decoration and not a style choice -- it exists
-- because Warner's identity carries a dimension the others do not:
--
--   * plm.wb_property and its siblings (20260813230000) key identity on
--     (source_namespace, source_id), with the property namespace pinned by CHECK to two
--     portal namespaces. A Warner source ID is unique only WITHIN its namespace, so the
--     namespace is part of the durable identity. 20260814233423 therefore writes
--     `'warner:' || p.source_namespace` into source_system, and a LIKE pattern is the
--     only way to admit an open set of those namespaces.
--
--   * The qualified plain values follow the same logic in the other direction. Disney
--     spans TWO portals (OPA and the DCP Vault), and the DCP Vault portal spans FOUR
--     licensors, so both sides need a qualifier. Paramount and NBCU each have exactly one
--     portal and one ID space, and each gets a bare licensor token.
--
-- WildBrain is in the Paramount/NBCU situation, not the Warner one:
--
--   * There is no source_namespace column, or any equivalent, on any of the eleven
--     plm.wildbrain_* tables created by 20260819014639. Nothing in that landing carries a
--     second identity dimension.
--   * plm.wildbrain_character is keyed (capture_id, character_source_id) -- capture_id is
--     the snapshot, not a namespace -- and its own comment states that identity is
--     character_source_id AND NOTHING ELSE. That capture-scoping is exactly why the issue
--     needs the durable home in the first place.
--   * The landing header records that the licensee account sees exactly ONE property
--     through ONE portal. There is no second WildBrain source to disambiguate against.
--   * api.source_capture_inventory (20260819151536) already classifies every
--     plm.wildbrain_* table under the source_system token `wildbrain`, spelled exactly
--     that way. Choosing a different spelling here would put two names on one source.
--
-- So: a plain, single, lower-case value `wildbrain`. Not `wildbrain_dam` (there is no
-- sibling WildBrain portal to distinguish it from), and not a `wildbrain:%` pattern
-- (there is no namespace to carry). Both of those are proved refused below.
--
-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WIDENED, NOT REPLACED. The constraint is dropped and re-added because a CHECK
-- expression cannot be edited in place. Every value the old expression accepted is
-- re-asserted below by real inserts, so a narrowing cannot pass as a widening.
-- =====================================================================================

alter table plm.source_resolution
  drop constraint if exists source_resolution_source_system_supported_chk;

alter table plm.source_resolution
  add constraint source_resolution_source_system_supported_chk check (
    source_system in (
      'paramount','nbcu','disney_opa','disney_dcpvault','lucasfilm_dcpvault',
      'marvel_dcpvault','twentieth_century_dcpvault','wildbrain'
    ) or source_system like 'warner:%'
  );

comment on column plm.source_resolution.source_system is
  'Durable source vocabulary. A bare licensor token where the licensor has one portal and '
  'one ID space (paramount, nbcu, wildbrain); a licensor_portal token where either side is '
  'shared (disney_opa, disney_dcpvault, lucasfilm_dcpvault, marvel_dcpvault, '
  'twentieth_century_dcpvault); and warner:<source_namespace>, because a Warner source ID is '
  'unique only within its portal namespace. Pinned by '
  'source_resolution_source_system_supported_chk.';

-- =====================================================================================
-- Self-verification.
--
-- BEHAVIOUR, NOT TEXT. Reading pg_constraint.conbin or pg_get_constraintdef and matching a
-- substring would pass for a constraint that accepts everything, and would pass for one
-- left NOT VALID. So the vocabulary is proved by REAL INSERTS that raise a REAL SQLSTATE.
--
-- WHY THE INSERTS GO INTO A LIKE-COPY AND NOT INTO THE DURABLE TABLE ITSELF.
-- The migration verification cost guard (scripts/check-migration-verify-cost.mjs, issue
-- #1285, documented in docs/migration-verification-cost-guard.md) refuses a verification
-- block that names a plm object in a read-or-write context, an INSERT included. That guard
-- is correct and is not being worked around: a bounded probe still must not put a row,
-- however briefly, into a governed durable-decision table inside the apply transaction.
-- `create temporary table ... (like ... including constraints including defaults)` copies
-- the CHECK constraints AS THE CATALOGUE HOLDS THEM at this instant, under their own names,
-- so the expressions exercised below are the deployed expressions and not a restatement of
-- them. DEFAULTS are included because two NOT NULL timestamp columns are only satisfiable
-- through their defaults; without it every probe fails 23502 and proves nothing about the
-- vocabulary. The copy is proved complete before it is trusted: it must carry the same
-- number of CHECK constraints as the real table AND the exact constraint under test. The
-- temporary table is ON COMMIT DROP, reads no data, and touches no row of the durable
-- table.
--
-- A NOT VALID constraint would still reject new inserts, so behaviour alone cannot see it.
-- convalidated is therefore pinned in the catalogue, alongside the constraint's identity.
