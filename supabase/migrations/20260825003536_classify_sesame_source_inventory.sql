-- Issue #1283: classify the Sesame Workshop landing family in the source inventory.
-- Reserved migration version 20260825003536; claim #1447.
-- Re-derived from the current origin/main view head, migration 20260820004338.
-- The complete prior body is preserved; only Sesame selector/classification/count/status/note
-- arms are added. Verification reads catalogues only and never executes this costly view.
