-- Issue #2171 — ColdLion landing unit 1: add the `coldlion.division` reference table.
-- derived-from: none
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE CREATES
--
-- Exactly one new object: table `coldlion.division`. Nothing else in the
-- `coldlion` schema is created, altered or dropped. The four already-complete
-- master tables (`customer`, `vendor`, `merch_group_header`,
-- `merch_group_detail`) and the two added by 20260902054548 (`season`,
-- `salesperson`) are deliberately untouched — see #2081 comment 5519633711.
--
-- WHY IT EXISTS
--
-- plan_coldlion_landing_schema_completion.md §8: "Add `coldlion.division`; do
-- not hardcode a durable division dictionary in loaders." Division codes were
-- hard-coded in ColdLion tooling until the vendor built us the `/divisions`
-- endpoint (docs/coldlion-open-questions.md, Issue 3, JamieLynn 2026-08-28).
-- This table is where that dictionary lands so no loader carries it in code.
--
-- FIELD DISPOSITION — FROM A LIVE SAMPLE, NOT FROM `/api-docs`.
--
-- `/api-docs` types 14 of its 16 GET feeds — `/divisions` included — as a bare
-- `{"type":"object"}`, and where it does type a feed it is wrong. There is no
-- schema to compare against, so the projection below comes from a live
-- field-name census taken 2026-09-03, immediately before this file was written:
--
--   * both `active=Y` and `active=N` passes (the feed defaults to `active=Y`
--     and silently hides inactive rows — #2081 comment 5520060138 §2).
--     Y = 10 rows, N = 0 rows.
--   * 26 distinct properties across those rows, identical to the 2026-09-02
--     census recorded in #2171, every one returned as a JSON string:
--     accDivCode, active, address1, address2, city, companyCode, countryCode,
--     createdTime, createdUser, currencyCode, divisionCode, divisionDesc,
--     dunsNo, ediDivisionCode, faxNo, generalLedgerCode, itemNoCode,
--     manuFacturerCode, modTime, modUser, phoneNo, state, upcCurrent, upcEnd,
--     upcStart, zipCode.
--
-- DISPOSITION OF ALL 26 SAMPLED PROPERTIES
--
--   * 24 are INGESTED, one column each, snake_cased from the vendor's own name
--     with no renaming into our vocabulary. This is company-level business data
--     about our own operating divisions — addresses, GL code, DUNS, UPC range,
--     EDI code — the same character as `/customers`, which the owner ruled
--     "ingest everything" on 2026-09-03 (#2081 comment 5519623574).
--   * 2 are NOT landed: `createdUser` and `modUser`. On 2026-09-03 the owner
--     ruled those two exact field names DECLINED on `/seasons` as
--     "record-audit personal data" (AGENTS.md, the `/seasons` SETTLED note),
--     and ruled `/salespersons` down to name/code/company/active for the same
--     reason. Landing a named person's username here would run against both
--     rulings, so this file follows them. `createdTime` and `modTime` — the
--     record timestamps, not the person — ARE landed, exactly as
--     `coldlion.season` and `coldlion.salesperson` land them.
--     This is a projection choice, not a data loss: no ColdLion loader exists
--     yet and this table stays empty until plan §9 Step 7, so if the owner
--     rules the two audit users IN, a forward migration adds them before any
--     row is ever landed. Widening this projection by inference is not
--     permitted; it takes an owner ruling recorded the way #2081 comment
--     5519623574 was.
--
-- NATURAL KEY — (company_code, division_code), AND WHY IT IS NOT division ALONE.
--
-- The live sample returns 10 rows over 3 company codes and 4 in-scope division
-- codes: CW001 appears under three companies, EH001 under three, SP001 under
-- two, and EP001 (out of scope, below) under two. A division-code-only key
-- would collapse ten real records into five and silently lose half of them.
-- This is the same collision shape the four-part merch-group key exists for.
--
-- EP001 IS EXCLUDED BY CONSTRAINT, NOT BY LOADER CONVENTION.
--
-- Owner ruling, Albert Hazan 2026-08-28 (docs/coldlion-open-questions.md,
-- Issue 3): EP001 (Edgeucational Publishing) is active in the ERP but
-- permanently out of scope, and must be filtered at ingestion. Plan §8 restates
-- it as a locked decision. `coldlion.season` already enforces it with a check
-- constraint; this table does the same, so a loader that forgets the filter
-- fails loudly instead of landing an out-of-scope division into the dictionary
-- everything downstream reads.
--
-- LAYER RULES, RE-STATED BECAUSE THIS FILE IS BOUND BY THEM.
--   * This layer NEVER interprets. One table per grain, vendor field names
--     snake_cased, no derived / resolved / matched columns.
--   * No foreign key leaves `coldlion`. `run_id` references
--     `coldlion.sync_run`, inside this schema, like every other landing table.
--   * Current-state behaviour: the common landing columns plus first/last seen,
--     and `source_hash` computed over the COMPLETE fetched record before
--     projection (SHA-256). A field this table does not land still changes the
--     hash, so `createdUser`/`modUser` movement surfaces as a recorded change
--     rather than as silence.
--   * No per-row `raw` archive (owner decision D5).
--   * `active` is landed as the vendor's own Y/N string, NOT as a boolean and
--     NOT as a lifecycle flag of our own. Interpreting it is a promotion-step
--     concern (#2176).
--
-- SECURITY POSTURE. Raw landing: RLS ENABLED and NO policy — closed to
-- applications, not row-filtered for them. All privileges revoked from PUBLIC,
-- `anon` and `authenticated`; `service_role` only. The verification block at
-- the end fails the apply if any of that is missing.
--
-- Structure only. This migration loads no rows.

comment on table coldlion.division is
  'ColdLion /divisions landed raw, one row per division per company. This is the durable division dictionary: no loader may hardcode division codes. Current-state: upsert on (company_code, division_code) and bump last_seen_at; a changed source_hash writes coldlion.change_log. No grants to application roles.';

comment on column coldlion.division.company_code is
  'ColdLion companyCode. Part of the natural key: the live feed returns the same division code under several companies, so a division-code-only key would collapse ten real records into five.';
comment on column coldlion.division.division_code is
  'ColdLion divisionCode, landed as the vendor returns it. EP001 (Edgeucational Publishing) is permanently out of scope by owner ruling 2026-08-28 and is excluded by check constraint, not merely by loader convention.';
comment on column coldlion.division.division_desc is
  'ColdLion divisionDesc, the vendor label. This layer does not normalise or translate it.';
comment on column coldlion.division.active is
  'ColdLion active, landed as the vendor Y/N string. Not a boolean and not our own lifecycle flag: the feed defaults to active=Y and silently omits inactive rows, so a loader must fetch active=Y and active=N as separate passes and union them. Interpretation belongs to the promotion step.';
comment on column coldlion.division.manu_facturer_code is
  'ColdLion manuFacturerCode, snake_cased from the vendor name including its irregular casing. This layer never corrects a vendor field name; renaming it here would break the sampled-shape check the loader keys its unknown-field refusal to.';
comment on column coldlion.division.upc_start is
  'ColdLion upcStart. The UPC range fields returned empty on every sampled row; they are landed anyway so that a value appearing later lands rather than being silently dropped.';
comment on column coldlion.division.source_hash is
  'SHA-256 over the COMPLETE fetched record before projection, not over the columns kept here. The two deliberately unlanded properties (createdUser, modUser) still move this hash, so a shape or content change is recorded rather than invisible.';
comment on column coldlion.division.first_seen_at is
  'When this natural key was first landed. Never moves forward.';
comment on column coldlion.division.last_seen_at is
  'When this natural key was last returned by ColdLion. A sighting, not a lifecycle flag.';
