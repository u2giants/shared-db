-- core.franchise and core.franchise_alias -- the canonical Franchise entity.
-- Issue #2333 (structural successor to #1090). Claim issue #2387,
-- reserved version 20260905083426.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
-- ---------------
-- A 2026-09-04 reconciliation of current `main` against production proved that a
-- canonical Franchise entity is absent. Franchise-shaped truth exists today only as
-- SOURCE-SPECIFIC landing evidence -- for example plm.pmt_franchise, which is keyed
-- (capture_id, franchise_source_id) and is deliberately scoped to one Paramount
-- capture. Landing evidence is not a canonical entity: it cannot be referenced across
-- applications, it disappears when a capture is superseded, and two licensors may use
-- the same small integer source id for entirely different franchises.
--
-- WHAT THIS IS NOT
-- ----------------
-- This migration is ADDITIVE ONLY. It creates two new tables and nothing else. It does
-- NOT alter core.licensor, core.property, core.character, any *_ext table, any shared
-- provenance table, or any Asset table, and it does NOT change any existing view,
-- function, policy or grant. It seeds NO rows: no curated licensing data is authorized
-- by #2333, and inventing franchise rows here would be exactly the ad-hoc Master Data
-- load that AGENTS.md 6.4 forbids.
--
-- IDENTITY MODEL
-- --------------
-- Identity is SOURCE-SCOPED, not name-scoped. A franchise is identified by the triple
-- (licensor_id, source_system, source_id). Licensor is part of the key because integer
-- source ids collide across licensors -- Disney and Sega both number from small
-- integers, so a bare source id join attributes one licensor's franchise to another.
-- Names are NOT unique and are NOT identity: two licensors may legitimately publish a
-- franchise of the same name, and the same franchise may be renamed at source.
--
-- ALIAS MODEL
-- -----------
-- core.franchise_alias resolves an observed string to a canonical franchise. Its
-- normalization is source-neutral: it reuses core.normalize_popsg_property_observation,
-- the repository's single frozen observation normalizer (contract
-- popsg-property-observation-v1), rather than adding a second, divergent one.
--
-- Alias uniqueness is scoped to the LICENSOR, not global and not to the franchise. The
-- same observed string under two different licensors is legitimate; the same observed
-- string resolving to two franchises of ONE licensor is an ambiguity that must be
-- refused at write time. licensor_id is therefore carried on the alias row and bound to
-- the parent by a COMPOSITE foreign key (franchise_id, licensor_id), so an alias can
-- never drift onto a franchise belonging to a different licensor, and re-parenting a
-- franchise can never silently re-license its aliases.
