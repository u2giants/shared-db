-- Issue #2355 (successor to #1090) behavioural contracts.
--
-- These assertions do NOT check that a migration applied. They check that the database
-- REFUSES the specific mistakes the issue exists to prevent:
--
--   * an alias that crosses a licensor boundary,
--   * two different characters answering to one normalized name inside one licensor,
--   * provenance recorded with no source, or pointing at a row that does not exist,
--   * and above all: two licensors reusing the same small integer source id being
--     merged into one provenance row. Disney and Sega both number from small integers.
--     A bare source id is not an identity, and a royalty decision made on one is wrong.
--
-- The file opens its own transaction and rolls it back at the end, so every row it
-- creates disappears -- and so do the constraint DROPs in D6d, even when the file is run
-- by hand with `psql -f` and stops mid-way. The CI glob wrapper adds a begin/rollback of
-- its own; that nesting is harmless and is exactly what
-- core_franchise_canonical_entity_contracts.sql does.
