-- Rolled-back structural contracts for issue #2173: the ColdLion stage/page completion
-- ledger. Everything here is synthetic; no customer identifiers and no licensed data.
--
-- WHAT THIS PROVES, and why each one is here rather than assumed:
--   1. A window is stage- and division-scoped, under NULLS NOT DISTINCT, so replaying an
--      unscoped pull cannot duplicate a window or a page.
--   2. /prodHistory cannot be recorded without a stage (a stage-less request silently
--      returned only ISS rows for a window that also held INTRAN rows).
--   3. A window CANNOT reach state=loaded on one page when the vendor said there were
--      two - the forced 201st row case that objection U6 is about.
--   4. Pages must be contiguous from 0, all loaded, exactly one flagged last, and must
--      sum to both the window row count and the vendor's reported total.
