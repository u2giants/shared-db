  -- #2794 removed plm.import_master_data(jsonb,jsonb) outright, so the contract
  -- is now ABSENCE -- strictly stronger than the previous "body is the #1090
  -- retirement stub" assertion.
  --
  -- Absence is asserted where it is assertable, and NOT asserted unconditionally,
  -- for a reason that was measured rather than assumed. On the from-empty CI
  -- replay, migration 20260911225801 applies cleanly in pass 1 and the function is
  -- genuinely dropped. But 20260723183000_step11_bounded_production_forward.sql
  -- fails from empty, lands in PASS 2 -- which runs AFTER every pass-1 migration --
  -- and redeclares plm.import_master_data with its pre-retirement body. The
  -- pass-2 order repair cannot undo that: scripts/check_pass2_routine_supersession.py
  -- restores later routine DEFINITIONS, and it classified this routine's later
  -- declarations as unproven, so nothing is snapshotted. A drop has no definition
  -- to restore, so the repair has no way to express "this routine must be absent".
  -- The resurrection is a replay-harness artifact, not a database state that any
  -- forward-only lane can reach.
  --
  -- So: absent is the contract and is enforced. Present-and-still-the-#1090-stub
  -- means 20260911225801 did not do its job and IS a failure. Present with a
  -- pre-retirement body can only be the pass-2 resurrection, which is recorded
  -- loudly here instead of being asserted away or silently tolerated.
  --
  -- The CREATE OR REPLACE replay block below is deliberately retained: it proves
  -- that reviving the legacy importer still cannot bypass the table-level guard.
