# Orchestrator closeout — marker #2193, `shared-db.orch EDGE-DEV 2026-09-03b`

Session ending on explicit owner instruction: *"when there's a pause, let's Wrap
Up and hand to a new session. this session is very long."* Nothing here is
finished-and-hidden — every item below is either merged (with the commit SHA to
prove it) or still open and now queued as its own `db-work` issue so a fresh
orchestrator finds it without reading this file end to end first.

## 0. ⚠️ Decisions only the owner can make

**None — nothing in this workstream needs the owner right now.** No item below is
blocked on Albert's judgement; every open item is blocked on either ordinary
reviewer-pool contention or a known, already-filed, already-routed tooling defect
(#2208) that a fresh session should work around, not ask about.

One FYI, not a decision: `git worktree list` shows a large number of worktrees
under `.claude/worktrees/` and `.agents/worktrees/` accumulated across many past
sessions. This is routine housekeeping territory (`cleanup-worktree` skill,
`reap-merged-worktrees.mjs`), not something needing a ruling — flagging it only so
a successor doesn't mistake the count itself for a problem to report back on
(prior owner ruling, worktree/file counts are not a metric to chase).

## 1. What this application is

`u2giants/shared-db` is the single shared PostgreSQL/Supabase database schema
repository POP Creations' applications share. It is **public**. Structural
changes (tables, columns, views, functions, triggers, policies, indexes,
constraints) go through a governed branch-and-PR workflow with automated guards
(SQL checks, object-collision checks, migration-pr-lease checks, exact-head
AI-reviewer approval, a guarded-merge GitHub Actions workflow) because many
concurrent AI sessions across many machines can be authoring migrations at once.
An **orchestrator** session (this one) coordinates that concurrency: it dispatches
migration authorship to sub-agents in isolated worktrees, assigns AI reviewers,
and drives PRs through preview and merge. Only one orchestrator runs at a time,
tracked by an `orchestrator-marker`-labeled GitHub issue.

## 2. What we set out to do this session, and why

Continue from a predecessor orchestrator (marker #2168, handover issue #2189,
still open) driving four in-flight structural PRs plus priority issues 2127,
1966, 1984, 1987 to completion. Partway through, the owner said to wrap up and
hand off rather than keep running — this file is that handoff.

## 3. Current state — what is true right now

**Checked live via `git`/`gh` at 2026-09-03T17:50Z UTC** (do not trust anything
older than this timestamp without re-checking):

- **`main` tip:** `fac396d9092108d2a9cb9f69af5a7d85039ec45a`, committed
  2026-09-03T16:40:18Z.
- **Orchestrator marker:** issue **#2193** is the live one (`status: active`,
  `route_id: local_1f6eaa0e-b5c2-4f70-b3d9-ddf451025f3f`), confirmed via
  `node scripts/check-orchestrator-marker.mjs --resolve`. **Not yet closed** —
  closing it is the last step of this handoff, done after this file and the
  queue are in place.
- **Priority issues:** #2127 **CLOSED**. #1987 **CLOSED**. #1966 **OPEN**
  (tracked structurally via issue #2196 / PR #2201, fillfactor fix). #1984
  **OPEN** (implementation tracker; PR #2205 is its guarded-executor deliverable).
- **Predecessor handoff `HANDOFF.d/2026-09-03T0850Z-edge-dev-claude-orchestrator-2168-closeout.md`
  is kept, not retired** — its issue #2189 is still open and its named work
  (merging the same PRs below) is still not landed. Retiring it now would fail
  the successor rule (work not yet on `main`).

**Five structural PRs, all `state: OPEN`, all `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED`, NONE
merged this session:**

| PR | Issue | Title | Head SHA | Slot 1 | Slot 2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| #2199 | #2171 | ColdLion `coldlion.division` reference table | `755c928a67afb050d330ce1144162cd4886b08dc` | drawn, no verdict at this head yet | not drawn |
| #2200 | #2172 | ColdLion item header/detail/merch-group fix | `fc630d57a4d5b65fc3e1d626d3c03c31bf784559` | codex, holding | not drawn — all other reviewers busy |
| #2201 | #2196 | fillfactor 75 on `public.dam_search_documents` | `d0f76d1bcb47f398161d47634ae0b291989aee3b` | glm-5.3 (seq 1147), no verdict yet | not drawn |
| #2205 | #1984 | MG01–MG03 reclassification manifest/executor | `1be8a83d805dc1198816e07e20ed311e496911b8` | had an APPROVE (Muse Spark) at an **earlier** head `01c8d1d8...`; a new commit landed since, so that approval no longer covers the current head | not drawn |
| #2216 | #2217 | Pause kimi-k3 in reviewer rotation 24h | `70c54cb1c08443afa637e1c0a7434d26ced7ad0b` | grok-4.6 drawn ~17:25Z, no verdict yet | n/a (single-reviewer pause PR) |

**Why they're blocked — two distinct, correctly-diagnosed causes, neither of
which is the debunked "budget bug" (see §4):**

1. **Ordinary reviewer-pool contention.** There are 5 reviewers total; kimi-k3
   is excluded for 24h (this session's own change, PR #2216); at times during
   this session all remaining reviewers were simultaneously occupied across the
   5 concurrent PRs, leaving nothing to draw for a second slot.
2. **Issue #2208 (open, real, correctly left untouched).** Once slot 1 has a
   *recorded verdict* at an exact head, a first-time draw of slot 2 at that same
   head is refused by the tool. Sub-agents have been working around this by
   deliberately holding off starting *either* review until *both* slots are
   drawn on a given head — that is why several PRs above show a drawn slot 1
   with **no verdict yet**: the agents are intentionally not requesting a
   verdict until slot 2 is also drawn, to avoid tripping #2208.

**PR #2205's head SHA changed between two checks made minutes apart in this
session** (`01c8d1d8...` → `1be8a83d...`) — a new commit landed on it live
during this handoff's fact-gathering. This means any review/verdict recorded at
the older head no longer applies to the current head; a successor must re-check
`gh pr view 2205` fresh rather than trust the SHA in this table if any time has
passed.

## 4. Everything we tried that did NOT work

**The "reviewer-budget ordering bug" — the single biggest false lead this
session, now fully closed out.** Early in this session, three sub-agents
(dispatched for PRs #2199, #2200, and jointly #2201/#2205) were operating on the
belief that a live defect — `findBusyReviewers` running *before*
`requireReviewWireCapacity` in `scripts/manage-migration-author-lanes.mjs`,
causing spurious slot-2 refusals — was blocking their PRs, and that a fix
("reorder the checks") was needed or imminent.

**This is false, and the exact fix they were expecting was already tried once
and explicitly rejected by the owner.** A fourth sub-agent
(`ae0e58e6fec224e0a`) investigated directly and found:

- The defect is **issue #1834, already closed 2026-08-30**.
- Albert **explicitly rejected** the reorder/re-account fix in #1834 as
  "actively harmful... the textbook shape of a fix that satisfies the symptom
  and breaks the mechanism" — the pre-mutex reserve is an entry gate sized to
  the mutex-held section, not a spending estimate; shrinking or reordering it
  risks an operation taking the lock and running out of budget while holding it.
- The validated fix that **did** ship (re-deriving and *raising* the ceiling,
  not reordering) is already on `main`: commits `2a0d357f` (#1813) and
  `354c8905` (2026-09-01). Current `main` has
  `REVIEW_OPERATION_REQUEST_LIMIT = 25`, `REVIEW_MUTEX_SECTION_RESERVE = 15`,
  all 411 tests pass, and a regression test pins the real slot-2 cost at 23/25
  requests.
- Live coordination refs for PRs #2199/#2200/#2205 showed multiple *successful*
  slot-2 assignments with recorded verdicts in their head-SHA history at the
  time — i.e. these PRs were never actually blocked by this mechanism.

`ae0e58e6fec224e0a` correctly declined to implement the reorder fix, deleted its
own scratch branch, and this session then **relayed the correction to all three
other running sub-agents** (via `SendMessage`/checkpoint prompts) before
stopping them for this handoff. All three subsequently confirmed independently
(via their own fresh `gh`/ref checks) that the budget mechanism is fine and the
real blocker is reviewer-pool contention and/or #2208. **Do not re-open this.**
`scripts/manage-migration-author-lanes.mjs`'s check ordering must not be
changed on the basis of this premise again.

**Minor unresolved discrepancy, not chased further:** one sub-agent
(`ae0e58e6fec224e0a`) reported deleting its scratch worktree/branch for
`fix-reviewer-budget-order`, but `git worktree list` still shows that directory
present (`C:/repos/shared-db-worktrees/fix-reviewer-budget-order`) at
`main` tip with a clean tree and no divergent commits. It is harmless (no
uncommitted work, sitting exactly at `main`) but was not independently reconciled
this session — a successor doing a worktree sweep can remove it once confirmed
still clean.

## 5. Root causes and key findings

- The five PRs are not stuck on a bug — they are stuck on **ordinary contention
  in a 5-reviewer pool serving 5 concurrent PRs**, worsened this session by
  deliberately excluding kimi-k3 for 24h, plus the **real, already-filed** #2208
  defect for any head where slot 1 already has a verdict.
- The correct workaround for #2208 (already in use by the PR #2200 agent and now
  relayed to the others): **draw both reviewer slots before running either
  review**, so no head ever reaches "one verdict recorded, one slot undrawn."
- Subagents spawned via the `Agent` tool are **in-process to this session only**
  — a successor orchestrator session cannot `SendMessage` or resume them. Their
  live monitoring loops (e.g. the PR #2200 agent's "recheck every 3 minutes"
  loop) end when this session ends. Only what they've pushed to GitHub (branches,
  commits, PRs, coordination refs) survives; this file is how their state is
  carried forward instead.

## 6. Exact next steps

1. **Re-verify all five PR states fresh** (`gh pr view <n> --json
   state,mergeStateStatus,headRefOid,mergedAt` for 2199/2200/2201/2205/2216) —
   do not trust the table in §3, it may already be stale by the time you read
   this. You'll know you're current when the head SHAs match what
   `git log` on each PR's branch shows as its tip.
2. **For each PR still missing a slot-2 draw:** draw slot 2 first (before
   requesting/accepting a verdict on slot 1 if slot 1 hasn't verdicted yet), per
   the #2208 workaround in §5, then run both reviews. Use
   `node scripts/manage-migration-author-lanes.mjs --assign-reviewer --issue <n>
   --pr <n> --head-sha <sha>`.
3. **Once both slots have verdicts with no unresolved Critical/High finding**,
   drive the guarded merge per `.github/workflows/guarded-migration-merge.yml`
   (acquire preview lock → apply+prove on preview → acquire merge lock →
   `gh pr merge --match-head-commit`). You'll know it worked when `gh pr view
   <n> --json mergedAt` is non-null and the commit is visible in `git log
   origin/main`.
4. **After each merge**, release the author claim
   (`manage-migration-author-lanes.mjs`), close its tracking issue with the
   merge commit, and check whether its priority issue (#1966 for #2196/#2201,
   #1984 for #2205) should also close.
5. **Once all five PRs are resolved (merged or otherwise closed)**, comment on
   and close issue #2189 (the predecessor's still-open handover) and issue
   #2218 (this session's handover issue), each naming the merge commits, and
   retire both `HANDOFF.d/` files in the same PR that closes them, per the
   successor rule.
6. **Issue #2208 stays open and untouched** unless a fresh, separate
   `repo-session` picks it up per its existing REPO-SESSION routing — it is not
   orchestrator work.

## 7. Constraints and gotchas in force

- **Never reorder or shrink the budget/capacity checks in
  `scripts/manage-migration-author-lanes.mjs`** on the belief that they cause
  spurious slot-2 refusals — see §4, this was already tried, already rejected,
  already fixed differently.
- **`git branch --merged` cannot detect a squash-merge.** Always confirm a
  branch's PR actually merged via `gh pr view`, never via git ancestry, before
  retiring a worktree.
- Five reviewers is the whole pool; kimi-k3 is currently excluded for 24h from
  this session's own PR #2216 (expires roughly 2026-09-04T17:xxZ — check the
  pause comment's exact timestamp before assuming it has lifted).
- Draw both reviewer slots before requesting a verdict on either, to avoid #2208.
- This repo is **public** — never load an AI-generated merch-group mapping as
  a data source, never treat ColdLion field decisions as anything but owner
  authority (standing memory rules, unrelated to this session's PRs but binding
  on anyone touching ColdLion-labeled work like #2199/#2200).

## 8. Access and environment

- `gh` authenticated as this session's GitHub identity throughout; no
  credential issues encountered.
- No secrets were read, generated, or handled this session — **secrets sweep:
  clean, nothing to report.**
- Working directory: `C:\repos\shared-db\.claude\worktrees\shared-db-orchestrator-4d089e`,
  branch `claude/shared-db-orchestrator-4d089e`, clean working tree.

## 9. Open questions and risks

- **Risk:** if reviewer-pool contention does not ease, all five PRs could sit
  blocked for an extended period — this is expected/normal load behavior, not a
  fault to fix, per §4/§5.
- **Risk:** PR #2205's head SHA is known to have moved once already mid-session;
  treat any cached SHA for it as provisional.
- **No open question needs the owner** — see §0.

**Self-audit (handoff-writer skill, mandatory):**
1. *Street-newcomer continuable?* Yes — §1–§3 give the app, the goal, and exact
   live PR/head state; §6 gives numbered concrete next actions with verification
   gates.
2. *As effective as this session right now?* Yes — §4 carries forward the one
   piece of hard-won knowledge (the debunked budget-bug premise and its owner
   ruling) that took a dedicated sub-agent investigation to establish.
3. *Every relevant detail included?* Yes — background, current blocked state per
   PR, the two real blocking mechanisms, the workaround, exact next steps, and
   constraints are all present; part (b) below covers every sub-agent
   individually.
4. *Would §0 alone surface every owner decision?* Yes — swept §1–§9 and part (b)
   for owner-judgement language; found none blocking, stated so explicitly in §0.

---

## Part (b) — every sub-agent, individually

**All six agents below are in-process subagents of this session (spawned via the
`Agent` tool). None are resumable by a successor orchestrator session — once
this session ends, their live state and any background polling loops they were
running are gone. Everything known about them is captured here.**

### Agent: `a4f190fdd54b29d4d` — PR #2199 driver
- **Asked to do:** drive PR #2199 (ColdLion `coldlion.division` table, issue
  #2171) through review to merge.
- **Actually did:** monitored/re-checked reviewer state repeatedly; confirmed
  the budget-bug premise is resolved on `main`; made no code changes.
- **Found:** slot 1 drawn, no verdict recorded at current head
  `755c928a67afb050d330ce1144162cd4886b08dc` (deliberately withheld pending slot
  2, per the #2208 workaround); slot 2 not yet drawn — waiting on a free
  reviewer.
- **PR / branch:** #2199, branch tracked in this repo (not this worktree — a
  separate isolated worktree it owns).
- **Worktree:** live in the sense that its branch/PR are unmerged, but the
  in-process agent itself is gone once this session ends; no uncommitted local
  work reported.
- **Deliberately did NOT do:** did not draw slot 2 alone, and did not request a
  slot-1 verdict alone, specifically to avoid tripping issue #2208.

### Agent: `adb0a4ef9a0065439` — PR #2200 driver
- **Asked to do:** drive PR #2200 (ColdLion item header/detail/merch-group
  fix, issue #2172) through review to merge.
- **Actually did:** confirmed the budget-fix premise is live and working;
  identified that all 5 reviewers were simultaneously occupied (3 reviewing
  other DB PRs, kimi-k3 excluded, codex already holding this PR's slot 1); ran
  a background recheck loop (every ~3 minutes) waiting for a reviewer to free
  up. No commits, no merges.
- **Found:** PR #2200 head `fc630d57a4d5b65fc3e1d626d3c03c31bf784559`, no
  verdicts recorded, genuinely blocked on pool contention rather than any tool
  defect.
- **PR / branch:** #2200.
- **Worktree:** its background polling loop ends with this session; PR/branch
  state on GitHub persists.
- **Deliberately did NOT do:** did not draw slot 2 while slot 1 (codex) had no
  verdict yet, to avoid a premature single-slot state; was still waiting for
  reviewer availability at last check.

### Agent: `afd506edcdccbc84d` — joint PR #2201 / #2205 coordinator
- **Asked to do:** drive PRs #2201 (fillfactor fix, issue #2196) and #2205
  (MG01–MG03 manifest/executor, issue #1984) through review to merge, and relay
  the budget-bug correction to peer agents.
- **Actually did:** confirmed the budget fix is live on `main`; confirmed with
  the PR #2200 agent that its remaining block is genuine contention, not the
  bug; reported all five tracked PRs (2199/2200/2201/2205/2216) still open and
  blocked; made no commits.
- **Found:** design is working as intended — agents deliberately hold off
  lone-slot reviews to dodge #2208, waiting for reviewers to free up.
- **PR / branch:** #2201 and #2205 (two separate branches/worktrees it was
  coordinating, not merged into one).
- **Worktree:** not independently verified as clean this session beyond its own
  report; no uncommitted-work concern was raised.
- **Deliberately did NOT do:** did not attempt any budget/capacity code change;
  did not force a lone-slot verdict on either PR.

### Agent: `a958ce6c3a98ad75a` → checkpointed as `a50e473db73a0a7da` — PR #2216 driver
- **Asked to do:** drive PR #2216 (pause kimi-k3 24h, issue #2217) through
  review to merge; then, at session wrap-up, checkpoint to a safe stop and
  report final state (this is the same underlying workstream — the agent ID
  changed because the checkpoint request spawned a fresh continuation task).
- **Actually did:** verified working tree clean, no half-done mutation; read the
  live review-assignment record from GitHub.
- **Found:** all 11 required automated checks pass on head `70c54cb1`; reviewer
  **grok-4.6** was drawn for this exact commit ~17:25Z; no verdict posted yet
  (not failed — still in flight). This is the PR that actually implements the
  kimi-k3 pause described in issue #2217 and referenced throughout this
  document.
- **PR / branch:** #2216, branch `claude/pause-kimi-reviewer-24h`, commit
  `70c54cb1c08443afa637e1c0a7434d26ced7ad0b` already pushed.
- **Worktree:** finished from this agent's own perspective (nothing left
  uncommitted); PR itself still open/unmerged.
- **Deliberately did NOT do:** did not force or re-trigger the grok-4.6 draw:
  correctly waited for the natural review-turnaround rather than treating
  "no verdict after 15 minutes" as a failure.

### Agent: `ae0e58e6fec224e0a` — budget-bug investigator
- **Asked to do:** implement the "reorder findBusyReviewers before
  requireReviewWireCapacity" fix that other agents believed was needed to
  unblock slot-2 draws.
- **Actually did:** investigated first rather than implementing blind; found the
  defect already fixed differently (commits `2a0d357f`/`354c8905`, issues
  #1813/#1834) and found the exact fix it was asked to make had been explicitly
  rejected by the owner in #1834 as dangerous. Ran the full test suite (411
  passing). Correctly declined to implement anything. Reported that live
  coordination refs showed the affected PRs already had successful slot-2
  draws with recorded verdicts in their history at the time it checked.
- **Found:** this is the single most valuable finding of the session — see §4.
- **PR / branch:** none opened (correctly — there was nothing to fix).
- **Worktree:** reported as deleted (`fix-reviewer-budget-order` scratch
  branch); **not fully reconciled** — `git worktree list` in this session still
  shows the directory present at a clean `main` tip with no divergent commits,
  which is harmless but was not independently cleaned up (see §4 minor
  discrepancy note).
- **Deliberately did NOT do:** did not implement the reorder fix, and did not
  touch `scripts/manage-migration-author-lanes.mjs` at all — the entire point of
  its work was determining nothing needed to change.

### Agent: `a4cfb2a1b35f26413` → checkpointed as `a70ebf86201240f0c` — PR #2201 escape-hatch driver
- **Asked to do:** originally, escape the stuck slot-2 draw on PR #2201; at
  session wrap-up, checkpoint to a safe stop and report final state.
- **Actually did:** verification-only this final run — confirmed the
  budget-bug premise is stale and made no code changes; found pre-existing
  untracked scratch files belonging to other lanes (not created by this agent,
  left alone).
- **Found:** PR #2201 head `d0f76d1bcb47f398161d47634ae0b291989aee3b`, slot 1
  (glm-5.3, sequence 1147) drawn with no recorded verdict at this head yet, slot
  2 never drawn. **More importantly: issue #2196 (PR #2201's tracking issue) is
  currently queued, not active, in the migration-lane queue — behind issue
  #2198 in lane 1, both claiming the same table
  (`public.dam_search_documents`).** This table-lane queue contention, separate
  from reviewer-pool contention, may be the actual reason nothing is
  progressing on this PR specifically — a successor should check whether #2198
  is done/mergeable so #2196 can become the active claim in that lane.
- **PR / branch:** #2201.
- **Worktree:** safe stopping point, nothing mid-mutation.
- **Deliberately did NOT do:** did not touch the migration-author-lanes tool;
  did not force slot 2.

### Agent: `ab131d2290dd8846f` → checkpointed as `a2ce3428a8b4aa031` — PR #2205 driver
- **Asked to do:** finish PR #2205's review and merge it; at session wrap-up,
  checkpoint to a safe stop and report final state.
- **Actually did:** verification-only this final run (`gh pr view`/checks, `git
  ls-remote` on `db-review-*` refs, `cat-file` on the verdict object); confirmed
  no code changes needed, made none.
- **Found:** at the time of its check, PR #2205 was at head
  `01c8d1d84118fdbe5b22bbfb1f1735b6abee8dd2` with a recorded slot-1 APPROVE
  (Muse Spark) and slot 2 never drawn — matching #2208 exactly. **This head SHA
  is now stale: a fresh `gh pr view` moments later (during this same handoff's
  final fact-check) showed the PR had moved to
  `1be8a83d805dc1198816e07e20ed311e496911b8`** — meaning a new commit landed on
  #2205 live during this session's wrap-up, after this agent's last check, and
  any approval recorded at the old head no longer covers the new one. A
  successor MUST re-check #2205 fresh rather than trust either SHA above.
- **PR / branch:** #2205.
- **Worktree:** safe stopping point, nothing mid-mutation, but see the stale-SHA
  note above — something (possibly this same agent, possibly another process)
  pushed a new commit to #2205 after this agent's final report and before this
  handoff file was finished. Not independently identified.
- **Deliberately did NOT do:** did not force a slot-2 draw once slot 1 already
  had a verdict, per the #2208 workaround.
